<h2><a name="PROLOGUE" id="PROLOGUE">PROLOGUE</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE HORSES OF KING MANUS</span></h2>

<p>As for the youth who had tried to steal the white
horse that the King owned, he was bound hand
and foot and taken into the castle of the King.
There he was thrown down beside the trestles of
the great table, and the hot wax from the candles
that lighted the supper board dripped down upon
him. And it was told to him that at the morrow’s
sunrise he would be slain with the sword.</p>

<p>Then the King called upon one to finish the
story that was being told when the neigh of
the white horse was heard in the stable. The
story could not be finished for him, however,
because the one who had been telling it was now
outside, guarding the iron door of the stable with
a sword in his hand. And King Manus, sitting
at the supper board, could not eat nor refresh
himself because there was no one at hand to finish
the story for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>And that is the way that the story of The Boy
Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin.</p>

<p>But first I shall have to tell you about King
Manus and his three horses.</p>

<p>King Manus ruled over the Western Island, and
he had a castle that was neither higher nor wider
than any other King’s castle. But he had a stable
that was more strongly built than any other King’s
stable. It had double walls of stone; it had oak
beams; it had an iron door with four locks to it.
And before this door two soldiers with drawn
swords in their hands stayed night and day.</p>

<p>In those days, if one went before a King and
asked him for a gift the King might not refuse to
give what was asked of him. But King Manus
was hard to come to by those with requests. For
before the chamber where he sat or slept there
stood a servant to take the request, and if it were
one that might not be brought to him, to make an
excuse for the King.</p>

<p>It was all because of the King’s three horses&mdash;a
white horse, a red horse, and a black horse.
The white horse was as swift as the plunging wave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of the sea, the red horse was as swift as fire in the
heather, and the speed of the black horse was
such that he could overtake the wind of March
that was before him, and the wind of March that
was behind could not overtake him.</p>

<p>Many had tried to get one of the King’s horses
by request or by robbery. But those who would
ask for a gift were kept away from the King,
while the stone walls, double thick, with the door
of iron with four locks to it, kept robbers outside.
Besides there were the two soldiers with drawn
swords in their hands to prevent the horses being
taken out of the stable by any one except their own
grooms. And so it was thought very certain that
King Manus would never lose his famous horses.</p>

<p>But this very night, when the King and his
lords were at supper, the neigh of a horse in the
stable was heard. Then it was that the story-teller
stopped in his story. The trampling of a
horse was heard. Straight out King Manus ran,
and his harper and his story-teller and his lords
ran with him. When they came to the stable they
saw that the two soldiers were sitting before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
iron door fast asleep, with the swords on the ground
before them. And the locks were off the door of
iron.</p>

<p>Just as they came there the iron door of the
stable opened and the King’s white horse was led
out. He who had the rein was a strange youth
dressed in a foreign dress. The youth was about
to spring on the horse’s back when those who were
with the King sprang upon him and held him and
held the bridle of the horse.</p>

<p>And having secured the youth they went into
the stable, and they found the red horse and the
black horse eating at their mangers. They led
the white horse back and put him in his own stall.
The watchers who had been before the stable
door could not be wakened, so those who were
with the King carried them to another place,
and left two others, the harper and the story-teller,
to keep watch, with the soldiers’ swords in their
hands. As for the youth who had tried to steal
the white horse, he was placed as has been told
you, and every one there knew what doom would
befall him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then that the King called upon one to
finish the story that was being told him when the
white horse neighed. It was then that he sat
at the supper board, not able to take rest nor
refreshment on account of his not having heard the
story to its end. And it was then that one of the
lords said to the King, “Let the youth who is lying
bound beside the trestles of the table tell us what
it was that made him go into such danger to steal
one of the horses of King Manus.”</p>

<p>The King liked that saying, and he said, “Since
my story-teller abides outside guarding the door
of the stable, I will have this youth tell us the story
of why he entered into such danger to steal one of
my horses. And more than that. I declare that
if he shows us that he was ever in greater danger
than he is in this night I shall give him his life.
But if it is not so shown the story he tells will
avail him nothing, and he shall perish by the sword
at the morrow’s sunrise.”</p>

<p>Then the youth was taken from where he lay
by the trestles of the table, and the cords that
bound him were loosened. He was put in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
story-teller’s place and fresh candles were lighted
and set upon the table.</p>

<p>“Your danger is great,” said the King, “and it
will be hard for you to show us that you were
ever in such danger before. Begin your story.
And if it is not a story of a narrow and a close
escape there will be little time left for you to prepare
for your death by the sword.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the youth in the foreign dress looked
long into the wine cup that was handed him, and
he drank a draught of the wine, and he saluted
the King and the lords who sat by the King, and
he said:</p>

<p>“Once I was in greater danger, for its mouth
was close to me, and no hope whatever was given
me of my saving my life. I will tell the story,
and you shall judge whether my danger then was
greater than is my danger now.”</p>

<p>And thereupon the youth in the foreign dress,
who had tried to steal the white horse that King
Manus owned, began the story which is set down
here in the very words in which he told it.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMAN’S
SON</span></h2>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Coming of the Enchanter</span></h3>

<p>My father (said the youth) was a fisherman, and
he lived on this Western Island. It may be that
he is still living here. His name was Anluan,
and he was very poor. My own name is Eean,
and the event that begins my story took place
when I was twice seven years of age.</p>

<p>My father and I had gone down to the shore of
the Western Ocean. He was fishing in the pools
of the sea, and I was putting willow rods into the
mouths of the fish caught so that I might carry
them in my hands to the market that very day
and sell them there. I looked out and saw a speck
upon the water, a speck that came nearer. I kept
watching it while my father dragged the pool with
his net. The speck became a boat, and the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
came on without sails or oars. It was a shining
boat, a boat of brass. I called to my father and
my father straightened himself up and watched it.
In the boat that came toward us of its own accord
there was a man standing.</p>

<p>The boat came into the full water between the
rocks, and then it sank down, this boat of brass, until
its rim touched the water. It remained still as
if anchored. The man who was in the prow of the
boat stepped out on the sand between my father
and me.</p>

<p>He looked a man of high degree&mdash;like a prince
or a potentate. He had a dark face and a dark,
curly beard, and he had eyes that were like hawks’
eyes. He had on a straight coat of a blue
material covered all over with curious figures,
and in his hand he held a long polished staff
that had the shape of two serpents twisting together.
He looked at me and I was frightened of
him, and I turned to my father. But my father
was standing there, holding the fishing pole in
his hands, his mouth open, gasping like one of the
fishes upon the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger looked me over again&mdash;looked me
over from my feet to my head, and then he said
to my father, “There is no need that he should
do aught about these fishes. I have need of an
apprentice, and it would be well for you both if
he should come with me.”</p>

<p>My father then found his voice, and he said,
“If my son does not sell these fishes in the market
to-day he cannot bring back the bag of meal for
our household.”</p>

<p>Said the man from the strange boat, “Bring me
to your house and I shall put down gold for every
copper that your son would get in the market.”</p>

<p>My father made a sign to me to throw the fishes
back into the water. This I did, but I did it
fearfully. And then my father stepped out of the
pool of the sea and he made a sign to the stranger
to follow us. We walked from the seashore and
up the path of the cliffs, and we went through the
heather of the headlands, following the goat
tracks till we came to the wattled house where we
lived. The man from the strange boat followed
my father, and I came last of all. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
I went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.</p>

<p>And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of meal amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brothers,
all older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting for
the herbs and the meal to be ready.</p>

<p>When my mother looked toward us she saw the
man from the strange boat. She thought that
some crime had been committed by me or my father
to bring a man of such high degree amongst us.
She and my brothers were greatly afraid, for they
were poor, and those who were high were harsh
to them. But the stranger spoke softly, saying,
“Good fortune has come to you from the sea
to-day.” And when they all turned toward him
he said, “I who am very knowledgeable will take
your son with me as an apprentice, and I shall
instruct him in arts and crafts and mysteries.”</p>

<p>My mother said, “The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
But the man from the strange boat said, “I would
not take him to instruct him in arts and crafts and
mysteries if he were a day older than he is now.”
He said no more, but he went to the table and he
laid down on it piece after piece of shining gold.</p>

<p>My father went to the table and held his hands
around the gold. My mother looked on me who
was just twice seven years old that day. I know
she thought that she could never bear to part with
me. But then she looked on her other sons, and
she saw that they were men grown, and she thought
they should have more to eat than the meal and
the green herbs that were in the pot. She threw
her arms around me and I knew it was a last
clasp.</p>

<p>“He will have to go into far places to learn the
arts and crafts and mysteries that I would teach
him,” the stranger said. “Will he ever come back
to me?” cried my mother. “He will come back
to you when his cunning baffles my cunning,”
was what the stranger said.</p>

<p>My father took the gold that was on the table
and made it into a heap. My mother took her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
arms from around my neck, and my brothers
kissed me farewell. Then the man from the
strange boat opened the door of our wattled house
and went out, and I followed him.</p>

<p>We did not go back to the place where he had
left his boat of brass. We went to another place
where there was a harbor with ships. There we
found a ship ready to sail for Urth.</p>

<p>My master sent me on board to ask the captain
if he would take us on a voyage beyond Urth.
The captain said that if my master would guide
them past the Magnetberg he would give him the
ship to sail where he would after the cargo had been
landed. My master said he would do this, and we
went on board the ship. It was evening now, and
a breeze came up, and the ship sailed away,
bringing me from the place where I was born and
reared and toward the strange countries that were
beyond the rim of the sea. I asked one of the
sailors what was the Magnetberg, and he told me
that it was a mountain of loadstone that drew the
iron out of ships that came near it and left them
loosened timbers upon the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Inaccessible Island</span></h3>

<p>You have heard me so far, O King. Know
now that the one to whom I was apprenticed was
an Enchanter. His name is Zabulun, and in all
the world there are only three Enchanters more
powerful than he. The first is Chiron the Centaur,
who is half man and half horse, and who
taught Achilles and made him the greatest of the
princes who had gone against Troy. The second
is Hermes Trismegistus, the wise Egyptian. And
the third is Merlin the Enchanter, whose home
is in an island that is west of your Western
Island.</p>

<p>When the night came on, Zabulun took the
steering gear into his hands, and he steered the
ship by a star that he alone knew. When the
morning came we saw on the sea all around us the
masts and the spars and the timbers of ships that
had come too near the Magnetberg, and that had
lost their nails and bolts, and had become loosened
timbers on the waters. Those on the ship were
greatly afraid, and the captain walked up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
down, pulling at his beard. The night came on,
and again my master took the steering gear into
his own hands and steered the ship by a star that
he alone knew of. And when the morning came
there were no masts and spars of ships, and no
loosened timbers afloat on the waters. The
captain laughed and made all on the ship rejoice
that they had passed the dangerous neighborhood
of the Magnetberg&mdash;that mountain of
loadstone that drew the iron out of ships as a
magnet draws pins on a table.</p>

<p>We came to Urth. The great cargo that was on
the ship was for the King of Urth, and it was taken
off and sent over the mountain to the King’s
city in packs that the sailors carried on their backs.
Then the captain gave the ship over to my master
to sail it where he would.</p>

<p>He did not come upon the land nor did he look
upon the country at all. But when the last
pack had been carried off the ship, he said to me:</p>

<p>“You will have to do this, my first command to
you. Go on the land. Stay by a pool that is
close to the forest. Birds will come down to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
pool&mdash;birds of the whiteness of swans, but smaller.
Set snares and catch some of these birds, not less
than four, and bring them to me uninjured.”</p>

<p>And I went on the land and came to the pool
that was close to the forest. And there I saw the
birds that were of the whiteness of swans, but
smaller. I watched them for a while so that I
might know their ways. Then I made a crib of
rods and set it to catch the birds. One went under
the crib, and I pulled the string and caught the
first bird. And then, hours afterward, I caught
another. And waiting and watching very carefully,
I caught a third. The fourth bird was wary,
and I feared I should not catch it, for night was
coming down and the birds were making flocks to
fly away. One remained near the crib, and its
neck was stretched toward it. But then it shook
its wings, and I thought it was going to fly to the
others. It went under the crib. Then I pulled
the string and caught the fourth bird.</p>

<p>I brought the birds to the ship and my master
gave them grains to feed on. At night we sailed
away. My master held the steering gear while it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
was dark, but when light came he gave it to me to
hold. Then he unloosed one of the birds. It
flew in the middle distance, winging slowly, and
remaining a long time in sight. He told me to
hold the course of the ship to the flight of the
bird.</p>

<p>At night he took the steering gear again into
his hands and held the ship on her course. In the
daylight he unloosed another bird and bade me
steer by its flight. And this was done for two
more days.</p>

<p>The morning after the last of the white birds
had been freed my master bade me look out for
land. I saw something low upon the water. “It
is the Inaccessible Island,” said my master,
“where I have my dwelling and my working place.”
He steered the ship to where the water flowed
swiftly into a great cave that was like a dragon’s
mouth. In that cave there was a place for the
mooring of ships. The Enchanter moored the
ship in its place, and then he took me up the rocky
landing place.</p>

<p>There was a flight of great steps leading from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the landing place&mdash;it was in a cave as I have
told you&mdash;up to the light of day. There were a
thousand wide black steps in that flight. The
Enchanter took into his hands the black staff
that was shaped as two serpents twisting together,
and he took me with him up the stairway.</p>

<p>We came out on a level place and I saw a high
castle before me. There was no wall around the
castle, and there was no gate to be opened. But
when I came near it I found I could take no step
onward. I went up, and I went down, and I
tried to go onward, but I could not. Then
Zabulun the Enchanter said to me:</p>

<p>“Around this castle of mine is a wall of air.
No one can see the wall, but no one can pass it.
And a bridge of air crosses my wall of air.
Come now with me and I will take you over the
bridge.”</p>

<p>As the wall of air that went round the Enchanter’s
castle was not to be seen, neither was
the bridge that went across the wall of air.
But I saw my master mounting up and walking
across as on a bridge. And although I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
nothing before me nor beneath me, I mounted
upon something and walked across something.
Following him I went downward and into the
courtyard of the castle.</p>

<p>Within that courtyard there was a horse of brass
with a giant man of brass upon it, the giant man
holding a great bow in his hands. My master
said to me, “If one came over the bridge of air
without my authority, the arrow of that bow would
be loosened, and he who came across the bridge
would be slain by this giant man of brass.” We
went within the castle. In the hall were benches
and tables, and there were statues holding torches
in their hands standing by the wall. Also in that
hall there was the statue of a woman holding a
dart in her hand. When my master came within,
the statue that held the dart flung it, and the
dart struck a gleaming carbuncle that was in the
wall. Lights came into the torches that the
statues held, and all the hall was lighted up.</p>

<p>I sat with my master at a table, and the statues
moved to us, bringing us wine and fruits. We ate
and drank, and afterward a golden figure came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the Enchanter, and, sitting down before him,
played a game of chess with him.</p>

<p>The next day my master showed me more of
the wonders of the Inaccessible Island. No ships
came near, for there was no way to come to that
island except by following the birds that were of
the whiteness of a swan and that flew always in
the middle distance. On this island Zabulun
the Enchanter had lived for longer than the lifetimes
of many men, studying magic and all the
ways of enchantment. And for three years I,
Eean, the son of the fisherman of the Western
Island, stayed with him, learning such things as
were proper for one apprenticed to an Enchanter
to know.</p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">The Enchanter Goes to Babylon</span></h3>

<p>In the three years that were passed in the Inaccessible
Island, nothing that is worth my telling
happened, O King. But at the end of the three
years my master said to me, “We will leave the
Inaccessible Island, for I have a mighty business
before me.” And when I asked, “Where do we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
go, O master?” he answered, “We go to Babylon.”</p>

<p>And then, when it was the first day after the new
moon, we descended the black stairway that led
into the cave where the waters came. There we
found a boat of brass that was like the boat that
came to the Western Island on the day when my
father and I were fishing in the pools of the sea.
We went into that boat of brass, and it took us
through the water, steering itself. We rested
on lonely islands, and at last we came to a mainland,
and there the Enchanter left the boat
to sink beneath the water. As travelers then
we went on. We came to a town, and there
my master bought for himself and me the dresses
of merchants. Then we came to the river that
flows toward Babylon. Men go down the river
in round boats that are made of rods woven together.
In every boat a live ass is carried, and
when the cargo is landed the boats are broken up,
for they cannot go back against the current of the
river. And the cargo is loaded on the ass and
brought into the market in Babylon. And whatsoever
the merchants buy in Babylon is loaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
on the ass, and the ass is driven back over the
mountains into the country that they came from,
these men.</p>

<p>And in such boats we went down the river and
came into Babylon. No city in the world is as
mighty or as wonderful as Babylon. It has three
hundred and sixty-five streets, and in every street
there are three hundred and sixty-five palaces,
and to every palace there are three hundred and
sixty-five steps leading up to its door of gold and
ebony. The streets when we came into them
were thronged with mighty, black-bearded men. I
was much in dread when I stood in those great
streets, and looked on the mighty men who went
through them.</p>

<p>In the center of the city were the palace and the
wide-spreading gardens of the King. In those
gardens, as my master told me, were one or two of
all the beautiful or terrible animals of the world.
Those gardens I will speak of again, O King,
for it was within them that I came upon the
danger that was greater than the danger that
I am now in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>But first the Enchanter showed me that great
wonder that was near the gardens&mdash;the Tower
of Babylon. It was a red tower mounting very
high into the air. Outside of it there were steps
that went round it and to the very top of
it&mdash;a thousand steps. And on the top of
the tower, resting against the Spear of Nimrod,
was the Magic Mirror of Babylon. Zabulun the
Enchanter made me look to the top, and I was
made fearful by looking so high.</p>

<p>Oh, that I might tell you, King Manus, of the
wonders of the Tower of Babylon! In the shadow
of it there slept two mighty ones&mdash;the two Genii
who guarded Babylon, Harut and Marut they were
named. Giant beings they were. As they slept
there the beard of each was spread across his
mighty chest, and it was a beard so broad that
no horse of the mighty horses that the King owned
could leap across it. Very great but very old
were Harut and Marut, the Genii who guarded
Babylon.</p>

<p>I was made fearful by looking to the top of the
tower. And then I was made still more fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
by the words that Zabulun said to me. “We have
come here,” he said, “to steal the Magic Mirror
of the Babylonians.</p>

<p>“It is there on the top of the tower,” said the
Enchanter, “resting against the Spear of Nimrod.
One looking into that mirror sees all the Kings
of the world. The one who threatens Babylon
is shown with a spear raised in his hand. And if
a King should bring an army against Babylon,
the number of its men and the ways by which it
comes would be shown in the mirror. The Babylonians,
by means of this Magic Mirror of theirs,
are always ready for their enemies, and because of
this no King in all the world will venture to make
war on Babylon.</p>

<p>“But we shall steal the mirror and make the
Tower of Babylon fall. Know that I, Zabulun,
was once a Prince of Babylon. They dishonored
me, the men of Babylon, and drove me out of their
city. And for that I shall make an end of their
pride and an end of their security.</p>

<p>“Fear not. It will not be hard to steal the mirror
and throw down the tower. Know that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
King of the city is a foolish King, and that he
cares only for his gardens and for the beautiful
and terrible beasts that he can bring into them.
And as for the Genii who guard Babylon&mdash;behold
them! They are mighty beings, truly, Harut and
Marut! Immeasurably old are they, and they
pass their days in sleep beside the tower that they
guard. I say to you that it will not be hard to overthrow
the tower, and take away from the Babylonians
the Magic Mirror that is their security.”</p>

<p>As Zabulun spoke the terrible beasts in the
King’s gardens roared mightily, and Harut and
Marut, the mighty beings who slept in the shadow
of the Tower of Babylon, turned in their sleeping.
The flocks of birds that had built nests in their
beards (the oldest owl and the littlest humming
bird were amongst them) flew up and rested on the
steps of the tower.</p>

<p>The black-bearded men of Babylon passed in
their throngs, while he who was once a prince in
their city, and who was now Zabulun the Enchanter,
stood there with his staff in his hands and
smiling to himself. And I, Eean, The Boy Ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>prenticed
to the Enchanter, felt as if I were falling,
falling down from the top of the tower.</p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">The Palace of the King of Babylon</span></h3>

<p>And now at the supper board of King Manus
those who were eating, or drinking, or whispering
to each other as the youth began his story, became
silent and eager when he spoke of Babylon and
the Tower of Babylon. The King himself was
fain to hear about that city that was the greatest
in the world, and about the King who was the
mightiest of all Kings, and he commanded the
attendants to cease going here and there. So the
servers and chamberlains and stewards, with the
dishes, and napkins, and rods of office in their
hands, stood still behind those who were seated at
the table. The lords leaned forward with their
eyes upon the youth who sat in the story-teller’s
place, and the King made a sign for him to tell
on. But the youth Eean was speechless for a
while. Such was the memory of the high Tower
of Babylon upon him that had he been standing
he would have fallen down. His head sank on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the arm rest of the chair, and those near him who
touched his hand felt it chilled. Then King
Manus signed for a chamberlain to go to him, and
he went and wiped Eean’s brow with a napkin,
and then brought him a goblet of the richest wine.
He raised up his head and drank, and looked down
the table, and saw the high candles that burned
brightly, and saw the face of the King and the
faces of the lords who sat with the King. But for
a while his look was the look of a man whose spirit
is in another place. He heard the words that were
spoken around him&mdash;words that were about the
King of Babylon, and the King of Babylon’s
palace. The youth caught at these words, and
went on to speak of what befell him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The walls of the King’s palace (said Eean, The
Boy Apprenticed to an Enchanter) make seven
circles, one wall rising higher than the other, and
each wall having a different color. The first
wall is white, the second wall is black, and the
third wall is scarlet; the fourth wall is blue, the
fifth wall is orange, the sixth wall is plated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
silver, and the seventh wall is plated with gold.
I was filled with wonder when I looked on the walls
of the King’s palace.</p>

<p>The Enchanter that day had put on the dress
of a merchant, but under it he had left his own
garb&mdash;the straight dress that had the curious
figures upon it. He took into his hand the staff
that was made of two serpents twisting together,
and he told me that the time had come to go to
the palace and speak with the King.</p>

<p>At an early hour, before it was yet market
time, we went through the streets of the city. The
soldiers let us pass through the Gate of Brass along
a way that has on each side great lions carved in
stone. We came to the palace, and my master
spoke to the doorkeepers and they permitted us
to enter. We went through the outer courts where
there were soldiers who carried naked swords in
their hands. And because my master gave himself
out to be a merchant from far-off parts, and
because the King greatly desired to speak with
those who came from far-off parts, we were brought
into the presence of the King of Babylon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked, O King Manus, like a King that was
of a long line of Kings. His black beard was powdered
with gold, and spices burned before him.
But his face was white, and it was like to the face
of a man in a dream. Only one person stood
near him&mdash;a dwarf from the Country of the
Dwarfs. He had on his head a crown of scarlet
feathers.</p>

<p>When we came before him, and after we had
bowed, the King looked upon us. He spoke to
my master, and said, “What have you to sell,
merchant?”</p>

<p>And my master, before he spoke, let fall his
merchant’s robe, and he showed himself in the
straight garb that was covered with curious figures&mdash;the
garb of a Magus it was.</p>

<p>“What I have to sell,” he said, “is the meaning
of dreams, O King.”</p>

<p>And now, O King Manus, I have to tell of a
cheat worked upon a King, and of a cheat worked
by my master, Zabulun the Enchanter, upon the
King of Babylon. Pretending to speak of the
meaning of dreams he led the King to destruction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
hoping thereby to encompass the destruction of
Babylon.</p>

<p>The King turned to his ancient dwarf and he
said, “Remind me of my dreams.” And then the
ancient dwarf said to the King, “Of the three
dreams that seemed remarkable to you, O King,
the first was the Dream of the Three Dishes.”</p>

<p>“It is even so,” said the King. “I dreamed that
there were three dishes set before me, no more than
three dishes. And then I dreamed that afterward
these three dishes were hidden from me
and were not to be found. There was no one to
tell me the signification of this dream.”</p>

<p>“The signification of this dream,” said Zabulun
the Enchanter cunningly, “is easy to discover.
In the lore of the Chaldeans a dish signifies a treasure.
You have dreamed of a threefold treasure
that is hidden away.”</p>

<p>But the dwarf who was beside the King spoke
up and said, “Why does a dish signify a treasure?”</p>

<p>“That is something I may not reveal,” said my
master, Zabulun the Enchanter, and he turned to
the dwarf the staff that was formed of two ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>pents
twisting together. The end of the staff
lifted itself as though the serpents were rising
up. The dwarf covered his eyes, and cried out,
“O Magus!”</p>

<p>“Remind me of the second dream that was
considered remarkable,” said the King. And the
dwarf said, “The second dream was the Dream of
the Laden Ass.”</p>

<p>“It is even so,” said the King. “I dreamed that
I looked down the Way of the Lions, and there
came along the way a laden ass. Of that dream
also those skilled in the signification of dreams
could tell me nothing.”</p>

<p>“And yet the dream is plain,” said the Enchanter,
looking full into the eyes of the King.
“A laden ass signifies a treasure found&mdash;your
dream is of a treasure being brought into your
palace.”</p>

<p>“It is so,” said the ancient dwarf with the crown
of scarlet feathers upon his head. “In dreams an
ass is always laden with treasure.”</p>

<p>“And what was my third dream?” said the
King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your third dream,” said the ancient dwarf,
“was the Dream of the Arrows.”</p>

<p>“It is even so,” said the King. “I dreamed
of arrows that were shot upward to a great height.”</p>

<p>And then the King was silent, and he and the
dwarf looked long upon Zabulun the Enchanter.
But Zabulun took a step nearer to them, and he
said:</p>

<p>“In the lore of the Chaldeans, arrows shot upward
signify a very high tower. I can tell you
now the significance of your three dreams, O King.
They are of a treasure that is to come into your
possession. The treasure is hidden. It is hidden
beneath a tower. The height to which the arrows
were shot shows that the treasure is hidden under
the highest of towers&mdash;under the Tower of Babylon.”</p>

<p>At the mention of the Tower of Babylon, O
King of the Western Island, a great fear came over
me, for I knew that it was now that Zabulun’s
plan for the taking of the Magic Mirror was being
put into practice. And it seemed to me that fear
came over the ancient dwarf too, for he fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
down upon his face. But rage grew in the King,
and his black brows drew together in a frown.</p>

<p>“Are you one who would have the King make
search for treasure beneath the Tower of Babylon?”
he cried out.</p>

<p>“No search need be made there,” said Zabulun
the Enchanter. “And yet if the King should
dream of treasure again it is proper that he should
sacrifice a black cock upon the place where the
treasure has been shown to be hidden. If that
be done the dream will be banished and will come
to the King no more. I speak as a Magus. But
now I have shown you the meaning of the three
dreams, and there is no more to be shown.” And
saying this the Enchanter put the garb of a merchant
over the robe of the Magus. A cup was
handed to him and a cup was handed to me also.
This was to signify to us that our speech with
the King was at an end. There was wine in our
cups, but bitterness had been mixed with the wine,
to signify that what had been told the King was
not pleasing to him.</p>

<p>We went from the presence of the King, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
when we were far outside the palace my master
said to me:</p>

<p>“It will come about that the King will search
for the treasure that I have put into his dreams.
Moreover, he will speak to others of this treasure,
and they, too, will search for it. It will come
about that these many searchers, digging for
the treasure, will break upon the foundations of
the Tower of Babylon. Thereupon I will take the
Magic Mirror and make myself the master of the
Babylonians.”</p>

<p>This he said to me as I went with him from the
King’s palace along the Way of the Lions. I was
affrighted, and it seemed to me that the lions that
were in stone looked ragefully down on us as we
passed.</p>

<h3>V. <span class="smcap">The King of Babylon</span></h3>

<p>We lived for a whole moon in Babylon, my
master Zabulun and I, before the danger that was
greater than the danger that is upon me now
showed itself to me. Just before the hour of the
market we would go through the streets of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
city and toward the great market place. Throngs
of people would be there, gathered together for
buying or selling, or for talk of the happenings
of the day before. My master would take me to
a shady place, and we would sit there, resting or
refreshing ourselves with draughts of the wine of
the palm.</p>

<p>And Zabulun would tell me that the King we
had spoken with was the most foolish King who
had ever ruled over Babylon. “Great and terrible
he seems when he sits upon his throne in his
palace,” Zabulun would say, “but for all that he
is foolish, and he delights more to come into the
market and hear the talk of strangers than to sit
in his council chamber.”</p>

<p>Again and again Zabulun would speak of the
King, and he would say: “Often he comes here,
and he sits in the market place and talks with all
comers, which is against the customs of the Kings
of Babylon. We will see him come here, and we
will watch him do what is reported of him.”</p>

<p>Seated in the market in a shady place I would
watch the throngs that moved about there. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
saw the merchants who had come down the river
in such round boats as we had voyaged in. They
brought casks of the wine of the palm to the market.
And I saw those who had come from Arabia with
spices, and my master would tell me how these
spices had been gathered. Some had frankincense
that grows on trees that are guarded by
winged serpents. Only with smoke of burning
styrax could they drive the serpents from the trees.
And others had cassia that is found in a shallow
lake guarded by fierce, bat-like creatures. To
gather it men have to cover themselves all over
with the hides of cattle, leaving openings for their
eyes only. And there are the merchants who have
the ladanum that settles on low bushes, and that
sticks to the beards of he-goats that go amongst
the bushes. Others have the cinnamon that is
used by birds to build their nests against high
cliffs. Men cannot climb these cliffs to gather the
sticks of cinnamon, but they make the birds bring
into their nests such weights as break the nests
down and so strew on the ground the sticks of
cinnamon. They slaughter cattle under the cliffs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and the birds fly into their nests with great pieces
of the meat, and the weight of these pieces of meat
breaks down the nests. And so men gather cinnamon
in Arabia.</p>

<p>And one day my master showed me the King
of Babylon as he came into the market place.</p>

<p>He wore a black cloak that had only one stripe
of purple in it, and a boy went beside him holding
an Indian hound in a leash. Having come into
the market the King seated himself in a special
place, and he drank wine and ate honey cakes,
and talked with the strangers that were brought
before him, and let himself be gaped at by throngs
of people. And then, from one to another of
those who were around him, my master and I
heard it said, “The King, surely, has had remarkable
dreams.”</p>

<p>In three days my master was sent for by the
King, and he came into the palace again bringing
me with him, and he was saluted as a Magus.
The King’s dreams were told to him. The first
dream was of a drinking cup that blazed with fire,
and the second dream was of a ram-headed man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
with golden horns, and the third dream was of a
soldier in a black cloak. All those dreams, according
to those in the palace who considered
dreams, were of a treasure. Zabulun, my master,
agreed that assuredly they were of a treasure,
knowing that whatever the King dreamed of after
he had put the thought of a treasure into the minds
of those in the palace would be thought to be of
that and of nothing else.</p>

<p>Then speaking as a Magus he told them that
the blazing fire of the drinking cup, the golden
horns on the ram-headed man, and the blackness
of the soldier’s cloak all signified the Tower of
Babylon. The King and the ancient dwarf became
very silent when my master spoke of the
tower. It was then that the Enchanter took the
staff that was made of two serpents twisting
together into his right hand, and declared that in
order to make the dream of the tower cease to
trouble him, the King should sacrifice a black cock
in the lowest place of the tower.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/illus_050.png" width="421" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Wine was brought us then, and my master and
I drank, and this time no bitterness had been put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a><br /><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
into the wine. We were given permission to go,
and we went from the palace.</p>

<p>As for the King and the ancient dwarf who was
with him, they took horses and they rode to the
Tower of Babylon, the dwarf bringing with him a
black cock for the sacrifice. Harut and Marut,
the sleeping guardians of Babylon, they looked on,
but they went past them and within the tower.
In the lowest place in the tower they made preparations
for the sacrifice of the black cock.</p>

<p>Zabulun and I sat in the market place and
waited, for my master said to me, “That which
happens to the King, no matter how great it may
be, he will speak of it in the market. We shall wait
here and see if the King will come here on his way
back from the tower.”</p>

<p>So in the market place we sat, my master and
I. And in the tower the King and the ancient
dwarf took the black cock and fastened him by
a leg to a ring that was in a very light board in
the floor. The cock, fluttering upward, lifted the
board. Looking down they saw a chamber beneath.
They went down into that chamber, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
King and the ancient dwarf, and behold! they
found in it a treasure of silver pieces, each piece
marked with the mark of a King of the old times
in Babylon.</p>

<p>Soon Zabulun, seated in the shade in the market
place, showed me the King and the ancient dwarf
as they came amongst the throng. The King
seated himself in his special place and drank
wine and ate cakes of honey. My master, watching
him from afar, knew that he talked about the
treasure he had found. For the dwarf who went
with him opened a leather bag and showed certain
pieces that made those around them gape in
wonder.</p>

<p>Not long were the King and the ancient dwarf
there before the Hour of the Market came to its
close. Those in the market left and went to their
homes. My master and I likewise departed.
But those who had listened to the King brought
with them the memory of the wonder they had
been told about. A treasure was hidden beneath
the tower&mdash;that was the thought that now possessed
every one. And when dusk had fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
upon the city companies of men made their way
toward the tower, carrying with them spades and
mattocks. The next day, when the King came
with the ancient dwarf, he found that all around
the tower, and all around the place where Harut
and Marut slept, trenches and holes had been
dug.</p>

<p>He himself, with a company of men, went down
into the lower chamber where the treasure of
silver pieces had been found, and there they began
to delve. The King found no treasure that day.</p>

<p>When he came out of the lower chamber he found
many around the tower digging and delving. He
forbade them to do this, and he set guards around
the tower. But in the night those who were set
to guard the tower began to delve.</p>

<p>The digging and delving within and around the
tower went on in secret as well as openly. My
master took me to show me what was being done.
“Foolish is the King, and foolish are the people
of Babylon,” he said. “What I have told you
will befall them. Very soon they will strike at
the foundations of the tower, and the tower will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
stand no more. Then will I take to myself the
Magic Mirror, and make myself the master of
the Babylonians.”</p>

<h3>VI. <span class="smcap">The Genii Who Guarded Babylon</span></h3>

<p>O King of the Western Island (said Eean, The
Boy Apprenticed to an Enchanter), I was there in
Babylon for the whole of a moon before the danger
that was greater than my present danger overtook
me. Often Zabulun, my master, went to the
palace of the King, bringing me with him. And
the King would now receive us in his cool chamber,
and he would permit my master to seat himself
on a purple cushion in his presence. The King
would ask him about the ways of governing a
kingdom, or he would tell him of his wonderful
gardens, and of the strange and terrible beasts
he had there. Or else he would talk about a
mighty treasure that was to be found, and of the
beasts he would buy for his gardens when that
treasure came into his hands. Zabulun would
tell the King of beasts he had seen or heard of&mdash;of
the aurochs with its mighty horns, of the uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>corn
that was so white and so swift, of the satyr
that is so marvelous that no one knew whether
it was a wonderful beast or a wild man. And
often, as they sat there talking, the King would
have his servants stir up the beasts in his gardens
so that their roarings might be heard by those in
the palace.</p>

<p>Over the King and the King’s ancient dwarf
there had come a change, I thought. For the
dwarf with the crown of crimson feathers on his
head would stand silent before the throne, silent
even though the King spoke to him, silent as if
listening to the sound that the spades and mattocks
made on the ground around the Tower of Babylon.
And the King no longer had the look of a ruler on
his face, but had the look of a watcher and a
waiter. There had come a change over my master
also. Zabulun the Enchanter had eyes like yellow
lamps, and they had become wider and more
gleaming as the digging and delving around the
Tower of Babylon went on. I could see his eyes
widening in the dark when I could hardly see his
face. And I began to have a great fear of Zabulun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
even though he was kind to me, and had taught
me many things.</p>

<p>And now I come to the day when that danger
beset me that was greater than my present danger.
That morning I had walked in the King’s gardens
with Zabulun, my master. I saw the great palm
trees that grew there. So high and so shapely
they grew that I was made to think again of the
Tower of Babylon, and I was shaken by my
thought. I looked along the great avenue of
palms, and I saw down to the lake where the King’s
blue herons flew. And from the lake coming
toward us I saw a young girl. She had laid the
long blue feathers of the heron across her breast,
and I saw her white forehead and her white knees,
for her dress was the dress of a woman of the mountains.
But she, seeing Zabulun and I, sprang as
a young deer springs, and went amongst the palm
trees. I kept thinking of that girl, and how free
she was, and how no terror of a falling tower
beset her as she went by the lake where the King’s
blue herons flew or rested.</p>

<p>Again Zabulun, my master, sat in the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
presence, and the ancient dwarf and I attended
on them. The dwarf’s head hung down where he
stood, and he muttered. The King’s voice was
low when he spoke, but Zabulun spoke loudly.
Also his yellow eyes shone as he twisted around
his finger a purple strip that had been torn off the
King’s robe.</p>

<p>And suddenly there came the mighty roaring
of beasts in the King’s gardens. The dwarf
looked at the King, and the King spoke to the
dwarf, and there was astonishment on both their
countenances, for no command had been given to
have the beasts stirred up. The King rose from
where he sat and went to the doorway. I, too,
saw what he saw. The doorkeepers, and even the
soldiers who had naked swords in their hands, were
fleeing as before some terror. The King shouted
his commands, but no one heeded them. I looked
upon the King, and the King’s wrath was terrible
to behold.</p>

<p>And then I saw the King himself draw back in
fear. What was it that approached? I, too,
looked, and there, O King Manus, as I declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to you, I saw Harut and Marut, the giant guardians
of Babylon, come through the outer courts
and toward the chamber where the King stood.</p>

<p>They were naked but for their great beards and
their flowing hair. They came with great strides,
but their heads and their hands were swaying about
like the heads and hands of men suddenly waked
out of a deep slumber. The ancient dwarf saw
them approach, and he screamed out and fled.</p>

<p>The King went out of the chamber and into the
hall where the great pillars were. I called to my
master, and he arose from the cushions where he
sat, and he looked upon the two who came nearer.
Along the line of the pillars Harut and Marut
came, but Zabulun the Enchanter looked upon
them without fear.</p>

<p>The King fell upon his knees as they came near
him. My master’s face did not become fearful,
but he, too, went down on his knees as if powerful
and unseen hands had forced him down. His
eyes did not lose their look of scorn, but he knelt
even as the King knelt. The King and the Enchanter
were both Princes of Babylon, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Harut and Marut showed themselves in their
might, there was that within them that forced
them to sink down on their knees.</p>

<p>And nearer and nearer Harut and Marut came,
their heads swaying about and their arms hanging
down. Nearer and nearer they drew. They
touched the head of the King, and the King lay
prone on the ground as though the life had left
him. They came to where Zabulun the Enchanter
knelt. But not on Zabulun’s head did they lay
their hands. They took him by the arms and they
held him. Turning around they dragged him
along the line of the pillars. I saw him being
drawn across the outer court and through one of
the great doorways of the King’s palace.</p>

<p>And then it seemed that I was the only one left
in the palace of the Kings of Babylon. The King
did not stir where he lay prone, and the dwarf
did not return, and the doorkeepers did not show
themselves any more. I ran from the chamber,
and out through one of the great doors, and into a
place where branches of trees seemed to shield me
from the terror that had fallen upon the palace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
And I did not know then that I was running from
terror clear into the mouth of danger.</p>

<p>For dire things had happened outside as well
as within the palace of the King. The beasts
that were in the gardens had broken out of their
pits and their cages. I saw the beasts and I felt
them all around me. I saw the hippopotami as
they lay with their backs against the crimson wall
of the palace. I saw the zebras stamp between
the yellow wall and the blue wall, and ostriches
run between the black and the white walls.
And when I looked back from where I was in the
gardens I saw monkeys climb on the golden and
silver walls, frightened by the lions that went
roaring through the courts of the palace. I ran
on and on, down the great avenue of palms and
toward the lake where the King’s blue herons flew
or rested.</p>

<p>I ran on. But I had gone aside from the avenue
of the palms, seeing a great buffalo that stood in my
way. Something caught at my feet as I ran on the
clear ground, and being pitched I fell into a deep
pit. I lay there, and I looked to the sky, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
saw that the pit narrowed to the top, and for that
reason was hard to climb out of. It was higher
again by my own height, as I saw when I stood
upward thinking of a way that might get me
out.</p>

<p>But then there came a sound that made me look
downward, a hissing sound. And when I looked
down I saw into what place I had fallen&mdash;into
the Pit of the Serpent. In the shadow of the pit
there was a dreadful snake. It was still in its
coils, but its head was raised, and it was swaying
toward me.</p>

<p>Then, O King of the Western Island, I was in a
danger greater than I am in now. This snake was
mighty enough to crush a man, and from that pit
there was no escape without help, and at that
moment there was no help. The snake raised
itself higher, and its eyes fastened my eyes. Judge,
then, of my danger, and whether it was not greater
than the danger I am in now as I sit here with the
gleam of the slaying sword before my eyes.</p>

<p>And then I heard a whisper that seemed to come
to me from the sky. I drew my eyes from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
snake’s eyes and I looked to the top of the pit.
One was bending from the opening&mdash;a girl, and
she had in her hands a little drum. She began
to beat on the drum, and the snake’s head that
was swaying toward me began to sway sideways.
The girl beat again on the drum, and the snake’s
head swayed and swayed and went down upon its
coils. At last the dreadful head was at rest, and
the eyes of the snake no longer fastened themselves
upon my eyes.</p>

<p>The girl who stood above the pit put down a
board for me to climb up by. I climbed, and I
stood outside the pit, and I looked upon the girl,
and I saw the blue heron’s feathers laid across her
breast. Then I sank down on the ground, and
for a while I knew no more of the world’s happenings.</p>

<h3>VII. <span class="smcap">Again the Horses of King Manus</span></h3>

<p>It was as if the eyes of the snake were still upon
him. Eean stopped in his story, and his eyes
were wide as if they looked upon a terrible thing.
One of the servers brought him a cup of wine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
placed it in his hands, but although he kept his
fingers around it, he did not raise it to his lips.</p>

<p>Nor did he appear to hear what was being said
around the King’s supper table: “A great danger
the boy was in, truly.” “The danger he is in
now is not as great as the danger he has told us
of.” “We must hear the end of this story.”
“It seems that he is too fearful to tell us any
more.” This last speech came to the ears of
King Manus. “Be not so fearful, boy,” said the
King. “You have been in a greater danger than
ever I heard a man speak of, and by my sword,
you are in less danger now than you were then.
Drink the wine that is in it and keep the cup you
have for a remembrance. I would have you at
your ease, too, for we will sit here and listen to
the rest of your story.”</p>

<p>When the King said this the lords who were
sitting around the supper board applauded, and
then the stewards signed to the attendants to
bring more lights in. Fresh candles were put
upon the board, and fresh torches were put into
the sconces, and fresh logs were put upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
hearth. When all this was done the King and his
lords turned their faces to Eean, for they were
ready to listen to the rest of the story. But the
boy had not seated himself in the story-teller’s
chair: still he was standing with the wine cup
between his hands, and still his eyes were widened
as if a terrible thing was before him.</p>

<p>It was then, as they were waiting for him to
begin, that the neigh of a horse was heard again.
It was a very shrill neigh, and every one in the
supper hall was startled by it. Out they rushed,
King and lords, stewards, servers, and attendants,
and they neither stopped nor stayed until they
came before the King’s great stable. Then they
could hardly believe what their eyes looked upon:
the iron door of the stable was open wide; the
watchers were there, but their heads were bent
in sleep and their swords were upon the ground.
Through the open door of the stable came the
whinnyings and the plungings and the tramplings
of a horse. Quickly they went into the stable.
There, by the light of the torches that the attendants
held, they saw the white horse and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
red horse still in their stalls, but the black horse
they saw rearing above a figure that was prone
upon the ground.</p>

<p>The blaze of their torches made the black horse
swerve so that his hoofs did not come down upon
the figure that was upon the stable floor. The
horse was taken hold of and put back into his
stall. Then the attendants raised up the one who
was upon the ground. “Another one come to
steal my horses,” cried King Manus. “Well, this
one shall pay the penalty that the other has been
delivered from.”</p>

<p>They took up the one who was on the floor of the
stable. They locked the stable door again and
they put a double watch before it. They brought
the one whom they had taken into the supper hall;
a lad, younger even than Eean, this second robber
seemed.</p>

<p>Eean was standing by the story-teller’s seat as
they came into the supper hall. Looking upon
the one they brought in he cried out in the voice
of the heart-broken, “O Bird-of-Gold, why didst
thou peril thyself by staying here? Too faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to me thou hast been!” Hearing this speech, all
looked on the one who was called Bird-of-Gold:
it was then that they saw they had taken, not a
youth as they had supposed, but a young girl
whose dress was a youth’s dress.</p>

<p>In the light of the torches and candles they
looked at her wonderingly. She had knitted
brows and heavy eyelids that gave to her face
the look of one who ponders deeply. And there
was such fire behind the depths of her eyes that
it seemed as if her thought was always burning.
But her lips were colorless and her cheeks were
thin and sunken; her hair and her eyes and her
eyebrows were dead black. And when they went
to bind her as they had bound Eean they saw that
her hands were finely shaped and yet strong and
hard.</p>

<p>“Who is she?” said King Manus.</p>

<p>“I have told you of her,” said Eean. “This
is she who found me in the Pit of the Serpent
and who drew me away from the venom of the
snake.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a while, and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
King said, “The chance that was given you shall
be given her also. If she can show us that she
was in a danger greater than the danger she is in
now her life shall not be taken. If she cannot
show that she shall be slain by the sword on to-morrow’s
sunrise.”</p>

<p>At that some of the trouble that was on Eean’s
face seemed to leave it. He cried out, “O
Bird-of-Gold, tell the King the story of your adventures
from the beginning. Bethink thee, Bird-of-Gold,
of the terrible things you have gone
through and speak to the King and the lords of
them. This King is very generous, and you may
win our lives from him.”</p>

<p>The girl who was called Bird-of-Gold turned
to the King her face that seemed to him to be
like the face of a slave and a victorious warrior.
Her hands were bound before her and her black
hair fell over her breast. Like one who was ever
ready in deed and word, as soon as King Manus
made a gesture, she began:</p>

<h2><a name="PART_II" id="PART_II">PART II</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE STORY OF BIRD-OF-GOLD WHO WAS
THE BRAMBLE GATHERER’S DAUGHTER</span></h2>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">How the Bramble Gatherer’s Daughter
Went toward Her Fortune</span></h3>

<p>I am called Bird-of-Gold (said the girl, beginning
her story), but that name did not belong to me
until I was a girl grown. Before that I had no
name. In the city where I was born and where
I lived I was known as “The bramble gatherer’s
child.”</p>

<p>My father was the poorest of all the men of that
town. He gathered brambles and thorns in the
wilderness and brought them in a bundle to the
hut where we lived. Then, while he was gathering
another bundle on another day, I would go through
the town selling the brambles and thorns for stuff
for the people’s fires. My mother I never knew.
I grew up with my father, and we two had even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
less than the sparrows. I had no playmate nor
no friend, and what I got for the thorns and
brambles I sold brought us but little to eat.</p>

<p>One day as I passed along the street of the city
it came into my mind that I was grown to be a
girl. The thought that I should go from the city
grew in me from that time. My father would miss
me, but he would flourish the better if there was
one, and not two, to eat the scanty meal that the
price of the brambles and thorns gained for us.</p>

<p>I got for myself the cap and jacket of a boy.
Then one morning when my father had gone from
the hut and had turned his face to the wilderness
and his back to the city, I went out of the door and
turned to the wilderness also. I took a direction
that would bring me far from where my father had
gone. I had dressed myself as a boy, and my
thought was that I would come upon a merchant
who would let me do service for him, and who,
perhaps, would take me on a voyage. And I
thought that I might win some fortune for myself,
and that then I could return and take my father
out of toil and hardship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>I came to the wilderness and I went through it.
When the sun was halfway in the heavens I came
to where there was a road. There was a pillar
before me and that pillar had writing upon it.
I read what was written there. The words were:
<i>They who take the road to the right will come to
their fortune at last, and they who take the road
to the left will be ever as they have been.</i> When I
read that writing I took the road that was to my
right.</p>

<p>I went along that road thinking every minute
that I should come upon something that would
bring me to my fortune. The light faded as I
went along, and soon I had to look about for some
tree or cave that would give me a shelter for the
night. At last I saw a hut and I went toward
it. When I came before the broken door I knew
the place I had been brought to. It was my
father’s hut&mdash;the hut I had left that morning.
And as I stood before it I saw my father coming
from the other side with the bundle of brambles
and thorns upon his back. Then I said to myself,
“How lying was the writing that said that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
who took the road to their right would come at last
to their fortune.”</p>

<p>I went into the hut with my father. In the
darkness that was there he did not see that I had
on the cap and jacket of a boy. He laid the bundle
of brambles and thorns down on the floor while I
went to prepare the meal for both of us. And
while my father was lighting a fire I took off the
cap and jacket of a boy and I put on my girl’s
dress.</p>

<p>My father, when he had eaten his meal, said to
me, “To-day when I had gathered the brambles
and had made them into a bundle I lay with my
head on the bundle and went to sleep. I awakened
feeling some warmth near where my head lay. I
looked to see if perchance fire had come upon the
brambles and thorns, and, lo! what I saw laid on
the bundle was the egg of a bird. The egg was
still warm, and the bird that laid it must have
flown as I awakened.”</p>

<p>My father showed me the egg. It was strangely
marked and was heavy for its size. I looked at it,
and my father said, “Take it to the merchant to-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>morrow,
and maybe he will give a coin for it, for
surely it is remarkable.”</p>

<p>The next day, when my father had gone into
the wilderness, I went to the shop of the merchant.
I showed him the egg that had the strange markings
upon it, and I asked him if he would give me something
for it. And when the merchant had taken
the egg in his hand he said, “This is something to
be shown the King. It is undoubtedly the egg
of the Bird of Gold.”</p>

<p>I was greatly stirred when I heard the merchant
say this, and I thought that perhaps my fortune
would come to me through this egg. I went back
to the hut, and in the morning, before my father
started off for his bramble gathering, two officers
came and they took my father and me to the palace
and before the King. And the King said, “It
is known that of all creatures in the world the
Bird of Gold is best worth possessing. For her
claws can be made into an amulet that will bring
wealth to the one who wears it, and the one who
eats her heart can never be slain by his enemy.
I would have the Bird of Gold whose egg you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
found. You know where she abides. Catch
her and bring her to me, and I shall reward
you.”</p>

<p>So spoke the King of our little country. My
father and I went into the wilderness to search
for the Bird of Gold around the place where the
egg had been laid. And in the very place where
before he had lain my father put down his bundle
of brambles and thorns. Laying his head upon
the bundle, he went to sleep.</p>

<p>I watched beside the brambles and thorns.
And after a time a bird came running along the
ground, and went fluttering up on the bundle and
made a nest for herself there. Small she was and
all golden except for the blue that was under her
throat, and the blue that was upon her feet. As
she was making a nest for herself I put my hands
upon her and caught her. I held her to my
breast to keep her from fluttering away.</p>

<p>And I said aloud, “O bird, now I shall be rewarded
for taking thee. For the King would make
an amulet of thy feet that he may have wealth,
and he would eat thy heart that his enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
may not be able to slay him. Greatly will he
reward me for having taken thee, O Bird of
Gold.”</p>

<p>And as I spoke to her and held her to my breast
the bird made a cry that sounded as “Alas, Alas!”
I looked upon her again and my heart was filled
with sorrow for the bird I had taken. Why should
her claws be made into an amulet for the King,
and why should her heart be eaten by him?
I sat there thinking while my father slept, holding
the bird very gently to my breast. And when she
cried again “Alas, Alas!” I opened my hands and
I let her fly away. She fluttered near for a while
as if to show herself to me, and then she rose up
and flew away.</p>

<p>My father awakened, and he said, “It is near
dark, and the Bird of Gold will not come now.
Perhaps we will find her on another day. The
King should reward us for our search, and now we
will go and tell him of it.”</p>

<p>So we rose up and we went into the city. And
when we came before him, my father spoke to the
King and told him that the Bird of Gold was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to be seen in the places where we had searched.
Then the King would have sent us away without
doing any evil to us only that one who was near
him cried out: “Behold, O King, and decree a
punishment for these two deceivers. One has
declared that the Bird of Gold did not come near
where they searched. But look on the dress of the
girl: All around her breast are the feathers of the
Bird of Gold.”</p>

<p>Thereupon I looked down and I saw that the
bird’s golden feathers were all strewn around the
place where I had held her to me. I was grasped
by the hands and brought before the King. And
he cried out, “Have you the bird hidden?” I
said: “No, O King. I let the bird fly out of my
hands.” Then the King spoke to one who stood
beside him, and he commanded that I should be
taken and put upon a ship and thrown into the
depths of the sea.</p>

<p>I was taken from my father who wept and
cried after me, and I was brought down to the
river and put upon a ship. The one who was commanded
by the King to take me and throw me into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the depths of the sea was a man with a great
hooked nose and a purple beard. On his hand was
a ring with a great emerald in it. He was the captain
of the King’s ships.</p>

<p>I was put upon the ship, and the next day we
sailed down the river and came out on the sea.
Now, although the King had commanded that I
be thrown into the depths of the sea, I was not
then in as great a danger as I am in now, O King
of the Western Island. For the captain of his
ships hated all the words that the King gave him,
and those whom the King would slay he would
save, and those whom the King would save he
would have slain. When we came into the open
sea, so that he might obey the King’s word and at
the same time make a mock of it, he had me thrown
into the water, but with a rope around my waist.
After I had been plunged into the water he had me
drawn out of it, and I was left living on the ship.
And from the captain who had had me plunged into
the sea in such ways and from the sailors on the
ship I got the name by which I have been known
ever since&mdash;Bird of Gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Man Who Was High in Fortune</span></h3>

<p>We landed in a country (said Bird-of-Gold, continuing
her story) that was three days’ voyage from
the river’s mouth. Then the sailors put swords
into their belts and marched toward a mountain
that was half a day’s journey from the coast.
They pitched black tents and they built a citadel,
and they made themselves into a band of robbers.
He who had been the captain of the King’s ships
was the chief of this band.</p>

<p>Every day they went off to rob caravans and to
make war upon the men who guarded the caravans.
And always they came back, my master and his
forty robbers, with no man of their band slain
and with no man wounded. Very rich and powerful
did they grow with the plunder they took from
the caravans, and my master, the man with the
hooked nose and the purple beard, grew to be a
King almost. Men far and near sent him presents
and men came to him promising obedience, and he
had state such as had the King of my country. But
he kept no men with him except his forty robbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one said of my master, the captain of
the band, that nothing could come to him except
good fortune, so great and so prosperous did he
grow. Men marveled that so many good things
came to him and so many evil things were staved
off from him. And all his band swore by his good
fortune. But one day a wise King who liked
him greatly sent my master a message that said:
“I rejoice in your good fortune, friend, but am
also troubled by it. He who is so lucky must pay
a great price sooner or later for his luck. Pay
the price now, before it is exacted from you, and
remain great and prosperous. Let the price you
pay be that possession that is dearest to you.”</p>

<p>My master, having received this message, paid
heed to what was said in it, for the King who sent
it was renowned for his wisdom. He made up
his mind to sacrifice the possession that was dearest
to him so that he might remain great and prosperous.
And the possession that he considered
dearest was the ring that he wore with the great
emerald in it. He went down to the seaboard
taking me with him, for he would let none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
forty men know what he was about to do, and he
took a boat and he went, I being with him, over
the depths of the sea. Then he drew from off
his finger the ring that had the great emerald in
it, and he let it drop down into the depths of the
sea. Afterward he sent a message back to the
King, his friend, saying that he had paid the price
before it was exacted of him, and that his prosperity
now would never fail, and that men would ever
swear by his good fortune.</p>

<p>After that he and his forty men went forth and
won more plunder than ever they had won before.
Also more men came from far and near, bringing
him presents and promising him obedience.</p>

<p>And now, being so prosperous and so feared, my
master planned to attack a city and make himself
the master of the King’s treasure. He told his
plan to his forty men and they rejoiced one and
all, and they talked to each other as if that treasure
was already in their hands. I prepared the
meal that was to be given him before he collected
his men for the march.</p>

<p>The meal was of fish. The fisherman who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
just come from the sea laid his net before me and
I took out of it an exceedingly large and beautiful
fish. I divided the fish and began to make it
clean. I found within the fish something it had
swallowed. It was a ring. And when I cleaned
the ring I found that it was of gold and that in it
was a most precious stone&mdash;a stone of emerald.</p>

<p>I brought the fish to my master cooked. And
to make him rejoice I brought at the same time
the ring to him. I told him that for the ring he
had dropped into the depths of the sea another
ring had come back to him, and that this was on
account of the great good fortune that was ever
with him.</p>

<p>He took the ring from me and he looked it all
over. He cried out that this was not another ring
but the same ring, and that the characters of his
name were engraved upon it. And he said that it
was by no means on account of his good fortune
that this ring had come back to him. Thereupon
he rose up and went outside, and gave command to
his band that they were to disarm themselves and
tie up their horses, and hold themselves back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
from making any attack that day. He then went
into his tent and sat at the darkest part of it,
his purple beard touching the ground, and all the
while lamenting that his dearest possession had
come back to him out of the depths of the sea.</p>

<p>The forty men disarmed themselves and tied
up their horses and sat in little bands playing
games together. I would have stayed about the
encampment making bread for the band, only that
as I came near the tent where the kneading
board was I heard a bird’s cry.</p>

<p>I looked, and I saw on the wellhead near the
Bird of Gold. The bird fluttered and flew as if
she wanted me to watch her. I followed where
she went and I was led far from the encampment.
At the edge of the wilderness she went amongst
low bushes, and after that I could not see her any
more.</p>

<p>Because I had seen the Bird of Gold once more
I went back toward the encampment thinking
about the days when I had lived in the hut of my
father, the bramble gatherer, and about the day
when I had left that hut, and had gone across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
wilderness, and had seen the pillar on which was
written that if I followed the road to the right I
should come to my fortune, and about how I had
come, not to my fortune, but back to the hut I
had left; and I went on, thinking of how I had
first heard of the Bird of Gold, and of how I
had given her liberty when I might have held her
for the great reward the King would have given.
I went toward the encampment thinking these
thoughts about myself, and thinking, too, of my
master who had such fortune that men swore by
the goodness of it.</p>

<p>I made my way toward the tent where the kneading
board was. And then I saw tents overturned
and lying upon the ground. I saw the horses of
the band straying over the plain. And when I
looked to the citadel I saw it smoking with a fire
that was burning it.</p>

<p>There was no stir in all the encampment. I
knew then that an army had come and had attacked
my master and his forty men in the time
that I was following the Bird of Gold or coming
back from the place where she had led me. I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
amongst the tents and I saw that the men had been
killed. And I saw the purple beard of my master,
cut off by some insolent enemy and left lying upon
the ground.</p>

<p>Then I ran over the trampled grass and made
for the wilderness. And when I came into the
wilderness I hid myself amongst the bushes that
the Bird of Gold had flown into. I thought that
a great army was pursuing me, and in truth I was
very fearful.</p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">How Bird-of-Gold Came to Her Fortune</span></h3>

<p>I hid at the near side of the wilderness (said the
girl, Bird-of-Gold), for I was too fearful to go back
to the encampment and too fearful to go farther
on. I ate the wild fruits that grew on the bushes,
and at night I covered myself with dried leaves and
branches and slept in a hole. I thought how he
had been destroyed, that man whose good fortune
had been above every one else’s good fortune, and
I did not know how such a one as I could keep alive.
I was fearful while I slept, and when I awoke
and sat upon a heap of leaves in that empty wilder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>ness
I was most miserable. I remembered the
writing on the pillar that told me to take the road
to the right on the day I left my father’s hut and
I put a curse upon the road I took. I cursed it
because it had brought me, not to my fortune as
the writing said it would bring me, but back to
the hut I had left. And things were even worse
with me from that time than they were before, for
my return had brought me to the encounter with
the King, and to the voyage with the captain of
the King’s ships, and to the dangerous place where
I was now.</p>

<p>But then I began to think that although that
road had brought me to my father’s hut it had not
brought me back to a life that was as it had been
before. What had happened after I had come
back to the hut had brought me farther away
than that road could have led to. Perhaps the
writing on the pillar was not lying, after all. It had
said: They who take the road to the right will
come at last to their fortune. Perhaps my fortune
was farther away than I had thought.</p>

<p>Then I said to myself that my journeys were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
yet ended, and that if I went on I should yet come
to what the writing on the pillar had promised.
I sat still for a while with this thought in my mind,
and then I rose up and went through the wilderness,
going straight on toward a star that was still
in the sky.</p>

<p>I left the wilderness with its low shrubs at last,
and I came out on a wide, green plain. Before
going on that plain I ate again of the wild fruit
that was on the bushes and I brought some of the
wild fruit with me. I went on and on over the
miles of grass. And when it was midday I saw a
whiteness upon the plain before me.</p>

<p>I went toward that whiteness and in a while I
saw that it was all in movement. There were
white living creatures there. I went on, and I
came near to where there was a hollow in the
plain, and I saw in that hollow a mighty flock of
ducks. They were tame, for they did not rise
up and fly as I came near.</p>

<p>I looked on them with great astonishment. I
had never seen so many ducks together. I looked
them all over and I made a guess that there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
a thousand ducks there. And I had never seen
such beauty in ducks before. For these ducks
were of a gleaming whiteness, and moreover they
had a shapeliness that I had never seen in such
creatures before. I thought and thought, but
I could not think how they had come into this
unpeopled plain in such a vast flock.</p>

<p>I sat down on the grass and I watched them feeding,
thinking surely that some one would come and
drive the flock to some market or to some great
farm. I watched, and the ducks ate and ate in the
hollow where they stayed. When the darkness
came the thousand ducks put their heads each
under a wing and settled down on the ground. I
pulled grass to make a bed for myself, and ate the
fruit I had brought with me, and lay down in a cold
place near the hollow.</p>

<p>I was awakened by the thousand ducks quacking
loudly, and I looked and saw that they had
spread themselves over the plain and were moving
in a direction. I thought I should follow the ducks,
and I did, and I was able to chase away two or
three foxes that would have hunted them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>They were beautiful, these thousand ducks,
as they went over the green plain. They were
shapely and active, and they had a wonderful soft
whiteness. The drakes were not colored differently,
but they had crests and tails that curled.
When they knew I was with them they did not go
straying here and there, but kept themselves together
as a flock and went marching in a direction.
I thought that they might bring me to my
fortune. And then I thought that this great
flock of ducks, so strangely without an owner, was
my fortune.</p>

<p>I was faint and hungry, but I went on rejoicing
in the beauty of the ducks. I gave them time to
feed and they fed. At last I came to the gate of a
town. The watcher was astonished at the greatness
of the flock and he called to the townspeople
to come out and fill their eyes with the spectacle.
They came and asked me, “Who are you, O girl?”
and I made answer, “I am the girl whose fortune
is in ducks.” The people came on the walls of
the town and looked over them, while the ducks
spread themselves out, standing still. And more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and more the people marveled at the number and
the extraordinary beauty of the ducks.</p>

<p>The people set a place apart for the ducks and
they gave me a shelter in which I might rest and
refresh myself. After a while I heard them say,
“The officers of the great King of Babylon should
see this girl and her ducks. There is a marvel
here for the great King to hear about.” People
came to see the ducks as a spectacle, and one
would say to the other, “No prince by any river
in China has such a wonderful collection of
ducks.”</p>

<p>And then I was told that the officers of the great
King of Babylon would come to look on my flock.
These officers had come into the country to get
for the King’s gardens birds and beasts that were
remarkable.</p>

<p>They came and looked on the flock, and marveled
that, whether they rested or were feeding, the thousand
ducks harkened to my call and went as I
bade them go. They spoke, admiring their shape
and whiteness. And then a dwarf who had a
crown of crimson feathers on his head came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
amongst them and the officers spoke to him. This
dwarf told me they would take the flock for the
King, and that they would take me also to the
great city, where I would have the office of minding
the ducks in the King’s gardens.</p>

<p>So I brought the thousand ducks down to a great
barge that was on the river, and I went on the
barge, and the officers of the King with the dwarf
that had the crown of crimson feathers on his head
went aboard of it, and we sailed down the river,
and we came into the great city. For two days the
King had me show the wondrous flock in the market
place as a spectacle for the people. All Babylon
came and admired the number and the comeliness
of the ducks. Afterward they were brought to the
lake that was in the King’s gardens. As time went
on many of the flock were taken by the purveyors
and killed and eaten in the palace. But still
they remained a wonder for their number and
their comeliness. The King often came down to
look on the thousand ducks, swimming on the
water, or staying in their companies around the
lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">Bird-of-Gold in the King’s Gardens</span></h3>

<p>No place in the whole world is more beautiful
than the King’s gardens in Babylon (Bird-of-Gold
said). My white ducks, when they swam upon
the lake, went amongst water lilies that were
silver-white or all golden. Beside the lake the
irises grew, depths and depths of blue and gold and
cloud-colored irises. I should never have left
the side of that lake if I had not wanted to be
amongst the trees that grew in the gardens above&mdash;palm
trees of many kinds, and great cedar
trees in the dark branches of which the doves built
their nests. Greatly did I admire the trees in the
King’s gardens, for I had come from a country
where there were no trees. All the palms were
there&mdash;the date palm, and the royal palm, and
the palm of the desert. They stood nobly by
themselves or they made solemn avenues that led
to monuments of the Kings of Babylon. In the
grass there were golden poppies and little roses
that just lifted themselves above the ground.
There were great monuments, too&mdash;statues of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Kings and lions and chariots, and these reminded
people of terrors and magnificences, and they were
as a great wind that blew through the gardens.</p>

<p>And there were tulips on the ground, and there
were golden fruits amongst gleaming leaves, and red
pomegranates on the high trees, and there were spice
trees that filled the garments of those who passed
with fragrance. And all in a garden to themselves
were the roses&mdash;a thousand rose trees, each tree
with a thousand opened flowers. I wept when I
saw that garden of roses, and I do not know why
I wept.</p>

<p>All the birds that were lovely to look at or charming
to hear singing were in that garden. The black
birds with golden wings from my own country
were there, and the birds of paradise from the
Land of the Burning Mountain. And it was told
that the nightingales of Persia and Babylon and
Arabia brought their young here that they might
learn to sing the more perfectly. Also there were
mocking birds that mocked every bird’s song but
the song of the nightingale.</p>

<p>As for the beasts in the King’s gardens, the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
one I made friends with was a lynx. He was not
in a cage, but went roaming about, watching everything
with eyes that never winked. And after I
had come to know him and had made friends with
him, the lynx brought me to the cages and the pits
of the other beasts and with them I made friends.</p>

<p>Of all the creatures that were there the one I
was most fearful of was the queen serpent that was
in the Pit of the Serpent. But the serpent allured
me, and I used to sit above the pit, the lynx beside
me, and watch her as she uncoiled herself
and swayed her head about. And as I watched
her I would beat on a little drum that I carried
with me. I began to see that as I beat the drum
and made music for her the serpent’s head would
cease to sway and she would lower it, and then she
would rest upon her coils as if she were sleeping.
So I grew to have power over the serpent, and
many times when I saw her try to draw down a bird
that had come to the edge of the pit, I would beat
upon the drum until her head sank down, when the
bird would rouse itself out of the spell that the
serpent’s eyes had for it, and fly away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>So I stayed in the King’s gardens, part of the
day with the thousand ducks that were about the
lake, and part of the day with the ever-watchful
lynx that went here and went there.</p>

<p>One day I came up from the lake after having
decked myself with the blue herons’ feathers that
lay about. I saw two where none but the King
or the King’s ancient dwarf ever came. One was
a man who wore a straight garment that had
curious figures woven upon it, and who carried in
his hand a staff that was formed of two serpents
twining together. The one who was with him
was a boy, and my heart went out to him because
he was young, and I had seen no one who
was young in my days in Babylon. The two
walked in the gardens, and I ran and hid from
them.</p>

<p>A day came soon after when I came up from the
lake and did not find the lynx who was my friend.
I went searching for him, and at last I came upon
him. He had gone up into one of the great chariots
that were for a monument to a King. I saw him
watching across the chariot. I went beside him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and the lynx did not move, but kept watching,
watching.</p>

<p>Before I saw what was coming I heard a great
trampling noise. I saw trees break and fall down.
Flocks of birds came flying toward me, and I saw
the deer start up and run. Then I saw enormous
shapes coming striding through the gardens.
They were as men, but as men high as towers.
As they came on, trees fell down before them, and
beasts broke out of their pits and cages and
crouched before them. The beasts were filled with
fear, and they roared and screeched and trumpeted
as if fearful things were about to happen to them.
The giant men passed where I stood in the great
chariot and they came to the gateway that led
into the courts of the King’s palace. They put
their hands to the stones above the gateway, and
the heavy, mortared stones fell, leaving them a
space high enough for them to pass through. I
looked from the King’s palace toward the city,
and I saw the Way of the Lions and it was black
with people that fled from the palace&mdash;soldiers
and servants and attendants. I saw the beasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of the gardens bound or crash through the broken
gateway, entering the courts of the palace.</p>

<p>I saw the giant men come forth from the palace.
Now they held a man by the arms and dragged
him along. They crossed the gardens dragging
the man, and for a time I watched the dust that
their progress made.</p>

<p>As I watched I saw some one come fleeing from
the palace. He ran on, coming straight to the
place from where I watched. He stumbled as he
ran, and I saw him fall into the Pit of the Serpent.
It had seemed to me as I watched him that this
was the boy who had walked with the strange man
in the gardens.</p>

<p>In my hands I had the little drum whose sound
could put a spell upon the queen serpent. I ran
toward the pit holding the drum. And when I
bent over I saw that the head of the serpent was
very near to the boy. I beat upon the drum, and
the serpent heard, and her head ceased to sway
about. Then her head went down, and she remained
in her coils upon the ground of the pit.</p>

<p>I drew the boy up, and I led him to the lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and I bathed his face and his hands. The day
had almost passed before he was able to speak to
me. Then he told me who he was, and what the
events were that had happened in the King’s
palace. And that boy is the one who is before you
now, O King of the Western Island, Eean, the
fisherman’s son, who was apprenticed to the
Enchanter.</p>

<h3>V. <span class="smcap">How Bird-of-Gold Went to the Top of
the Tower</span></h3>

<p>Long did it take Eean to tell me the whole of the
story, and when he had told and I had gathered
and put together all of it, I said to him, “Not yet
has the tower fallen, and ere it comes down
one might go to the top and take the Magic Mirror
of the Babylonians and put it in the hands of the
King.”</p>

<p>“The King may be dead,” Eean said, “or else
he may be in such a state that he cannot see or
hear any more.”</p>

<p>We were then sitting under the greatest of the
cedar trees, and he was eating pomegranates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
from my lap. I looked from out the shade of
the cedar tree, and I saw the King of Babylon
walking in his gardens.</p>

<p>The King was fearful; he looked to the right
and to the left as he went on. When he saw a
little deer that was standing still he was startled,
and he turned back. As he came nigh the cedar
tree he saw me standing there before him. I
prostrated myself and I said, “O King, fear not for
Babylon. The tower has not yet fallen, and the
Magic Mirror will yet be placed in your hands.”
But the King only said, “Go to the tower and bring
back to me the black cock that I tied to a board
but did not sacrifice.” Thereupon the King went
within the palace.</p>

<p>I called upon Eean to come, and we went down
the Way of the Lions, and through the Gate of
Brass, and out into the city. It was the Hour of
the Market, but there were no people in the market
place. We went on, Eean and I, and we came
before the tower. There we saw a throng such
as would have filled many markets, and they
were standing round and gazing on the tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>I had never looked before on the Tower of Babylon.
It was built tower upon tower to the height
of four towers, and its color was red. Around the
whole height of it went a stairway showing
steps on this side and that as it went winding
around. On the top of the topmost tower I saw
a gleam, and I knew it was the Magic Mirror of
the Babylonians.</p>

<p>That gleam dazzled me and put into my mind
the thought of going to the top of the tower. I,
out of all that throng, would go and bring down the
Magic Mirror! I went amongst them and they
let me pass, for I had on me now the dress of one
who belonged to the palace. I stood before the
throng and I saw where a great space of rock was
worn smooth&mdash;it was the rock against which
Harut and Marut had lain.</p>

<p>I came to the first steps of the tower, and I
climbed three of them. I heard the murmur of
those who spoke of me, and I stood still. Then
up the first round of the steps I went, keeping my
mind from the thought of the great height that
was above me. I came at last to where the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
tower grew from the top of the first, and I stood
and looked down, and I saw that the men below had
already become little. It was then that I felt
terror of the height that was above me.</p>

<p>I began to climb the steps of the second tower,
fearful to look down and fearful to think of the
number of steps that were before me. I went on
and up, all in a terrible silence, and feeling that
at the step above me something unbelievable would
happen.</p>

<p>After a great length of time I came out on the
space that was the top of the second tower.
On that breadth I rested. As I waited there the
coldness of death seemed to come over me.</p>

<p>But the coldness passed, and I felt the air again.
I found the steps that went up and around the
third of the towers. As I went on I felt that those
steps leaned down on me and crushed me, and that
with my feet alone I never could surmount them.
Then I went down on my hands and knees and I
climbed and climbed until my hands were bruised
and the parts behind my knees ached. I thought
that suddenly the steps would cease to be, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
that I should find no place for my hands, and that
thereupon I would fall down all the height I had
climbed up. But step came after step, and at last
I came out on that space that was the top of the
third tower.</p>

<p>Above me was the fourth tower. I stood holding
myself against it, and I looked down all the
distance I had climbed. I saw the great river
shining whitely: like pebbles in the bed of a river
were the throngs below. But now my fear went
from me. The silence was all around me, but I
was exultant because of the silence through which
I climbed. The height troubled me no more,
rather it made me exultant, making me feel as the
eagle feels. I came out on the top of the fourth
tower, and there was nothing above me except the
silent sky.</p>

<p>And there was the Magic Mirror of the Babylonians.
It rested against the great spear that
was Nimrod’s, and it was turned toward the city
and toward the King’s palace.</p>

<p>I looked into the Magic Mirror. As I looked
into it I saw a writing come upon it. I read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
writing, and it said: <i>Bring the Magic Mirror of the
Babylonians to the King of Babylon, but burthen
yourself not with the Spear of Nimrod.</i></p>

<p>And that writing faded, and another writing
appeared on the mirror. And the writing read:
<i>Zabulun the Enchanter has been brought by Harut
and Marut into the cave that is below the sea. For
forty days they will watch over him, but then they
will fall into a slumber. Zabulun will come forth
from the cave that is beneath the sea, and in anger
he will pursue him who revealed his plan for the
taking of the Magic Mirror. Take one of the rings
that are around the mirror. It will reveal when
Zabulun comes from the cave, and it will show how
near he comes in his pursuit of Eean, the boy who
was apprenticed to him.</i></p>

<p>That writing faded, and I saw the rings that
were around the mirror. I loosened one and I
took it off the mirror and I put it around the
wrist of my hand. The color of the ring changed
to the green of the sea.</p>

<p>I took the Magic Mirror in my hands and I went
down the stairway. Down I went, from the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to the third, and from the third to the second of
the towers. As I went down the stairway around
the first of the towers I heard the murmurs of the
throng. High above my head I raised the Magic
Mirror, and I went toward them holding it so.</p>

<p>And as I went amongst the throng I heard a
voice cry out, “The tower trembles, the tower
rocks.” It was the voice of Eean. As the cry
arose the throngs drew back from before the tower.
They ran, and I ran carrying the mirror, and Eean
ran beside me. And when we came to the market
place we two were alone.</p>

<p>We stood in the empty market place and we
looked toward the Tower of Babylon. In its
great height it stood there, strong and wonderful.
I heard the shouting of people around it. Then I
saw the great tower swing like a child’s swing.
Dust rose up, cloud after cloud, and cloud over
cloud. The cries of people came from out the
clouds.</p>

<p>We stood there until we saw the sun shine
through a cloud of dust. Then we knew that the
Tower of Babylon was indeed fallen. Never again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
did we go near the place, but from travelers I
have heard that where the tower stood there is
emptiness, and that great blocks of stone are
scattered far and wide.</p>

<h3>VI. <span class="smcap">How Eean and Bird-of-Gold Went from
Babylon</span></h3>

<p>We went into the King’s gardens, carrying with
us the Magic Mirror of the Babylonians. We
saw the great cedar tree, and we went and sat
under its branches and spoke of what we should
do. The Magic Mirror would have to be given
to the King, but for long Eean was fearful of going
into the palace.</p>

<p>At last we went to the doors. They were unguarded,
and we went within the palace. We
came to the chamber where the King was wont to
sit upon his throne, and we saw the King there,
and around him there were bearded men with
fierce eyes; by their fashion of carrying swords
we knew them to be the leaders of the King’s
armies. These fierce-eyed men stood with their
feet upon the steps of the throne, speaking in anger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to the King. They did not see us as we came into
the chamber. But in a while one caught sight
of us, and he uttered a fierce word. I went to
them, holding the Magic Mirror raised in my hands.
The King raised his head, and he saw the mirror,
and he cried out to us.</p>

<p>I went and left the Magic Mirror on the throne,
beside the King. I lifted my voice and I told him
how I had taken the mirror from the top of the
tower, and that now the tower was overthrown, but
the mirror was saved for the Babylonians. Then
the King said to the fierce-eyed men, “This is the
Magic Mirror of the Babylonians, and I say to you
that Babylon is yet in safety.” Again he said
to them, “Speak now and say what is to be done
about this girl who brought the mirror down from
the tower.”</p>

<p>One of the fierce-eyed men said, “Who is the
boy who is with her?”</p>

<p>The King looked on Eean and knew who he was.
He said, “This is the boy who was with the Enchanter
on whom be evil.”</p>

<p>The man said, “Banish the girl and the boy also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
but do no evil to them inasmuch as they have
brought to us the Magic Mirror of the Babylonians.”</p>

<p>The King said, “Take them from the city, but
let some treasure be given to them because they
have brought to me the Magic Mirror of the
Babylonians.”</p>

<p>One of the fierce-eyed men took us, and he
brought us into a chamber in which there were
many open jars. In some of the jars there were
gold, and in others there were silver coins. The
fierce-eyed man who was with us spoke to me, and
he said I might take from the jar with the gold
coins. I took many of them, and I tied them in
different parts of my dress. Then he bade us
follow him, and he led us out of the palace and
to a place where a chariot with two horses was
standing.</p>

<p>He put Eean and me into the chariot, and he
bade the charioteer drive with us out of the city.
The charioteer, a silent man, stood up in his
chariot, and lashed the horses. We drove through
one street, and then another and another street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and all the streets were empty. The charioteer
called to the guards of a gateway, and the gate
was opened, and we passed out of the city. We
drove on until we came to where there was a great
river. Then the charioteer halted, and he called
across the river, and a man with a ferry came from
the other side. He was a very ancient man,
and he had a beard of great length. The charioteer
said to him, “Old Man of the River, take these
two across and away from us!”</p>

<p>We went into the ferry, and the ferryman took
his pole and pushed across to the other side of the
river. The man in the chariot turned his horses
and drove back to Babylon.</p>

<p>When the ferryman had left us on the other side
of the river, Eean said to me, “Where now shall
we go?” I made answer and said, “We shall go
to my country, and to the place where my father
is. And it may be that Zabulun when he comes
from the cave that is under the sea will not be able
to find you there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<h3>VII. <span class="smcap">How Eean and Bird-of-Gold Were Pursued
by Zabulun the Enchanter and how
They Went to the Cave of Chiron the
Centaur</span></h3>

<p>O King of the Western Island, our wanderings
began on the day when the ferryman left us on
the farther side of the river. We went to the
country where my father dwelt. We found the
old man still gathering brambles and thorns for
his livelihood, and out of the treasure that had
been given me I gave him riches, and he had not
to go thorn-and-bramble gathering any more.</p>

<p>We had only been a little time in the hut that
my father built when a new color came upon the
ring I had taken off the Magic Mirror. Its color
had been sea green, but now a red line came across
it. By that we knew that Zabulun the Enchanter
had left the cave that was under the sea. And
the red line began to grow over the sea green of
the ring, and we knew by this sign that he had
begun to follow on our traces. Then said Eean
to me, “I will go from this place and seek a hiding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and it may be that I shall baffle Zabulun who
follows me.” I said to Eean, “I shall go with you
where you go.” “Nay,” said Eean, “it is not on
your account that Zabulun pursues us. He has
no rage nor hatred against you, O Bird-of-Gold,
and if I should go from this place by myself you
would not be troubled by him.”</p>

<p>Then I said to him, “O Eean, I had no playmate
nor companion until I met you in the King’s
gardens. Now I could not bear to see you go
from me, and where you go I shall go too.”</p>

<p>Afterward I asked him if there were in the world
any Enchanters who were as powerful as Zabulun.
He told me of Chiron the Centaur, and of Hermes
Trismegistus, the wise Egyptian, and of Merlin
whose home is on an island that is west of your
Western Island. I thought that only from one
of these Enchanters might we get aid against
Zabulun.</p>

<p>The red grew over the sea green of the ring, and
we knew that the farther the red grew the nearer
did Zabulun approach us. I wondered how we
might get to one of the great Enchanters. Hermes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Trismegistus, being in Egypt, was far, and Merlin,
on the island beyond the Western Island, was
farther still. I thought of Chiron the Centaur,
and it seemed to me that him we might be able to
find.</p>

<p>Now my father had lived a long time in the
world, and he had heard many things, and he had
thought over the things he had heard in the years
when he had gathered brambles and thorns in the
wilderness. I went to my father for word of
Chiron the Centaur.</p>

<p>“Chiron the Centaur dwells all alone in a cave
that is in the side of a mountain. The mountain
is covered all over with a deep and an ancient
forest,” my father told me. And again he said,
“Once I knew the direction in which that mountain
is, and to-morrow I shall go into the wilderness,
and as I walk about it may be that the memory of
it will come back to me.”</p>

<p>He came back from the wilderness in the evening
and he said, “Away toward where the morning
star shines there is a great waste. If one skirts this
waste one comes to a river the waters of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
are as cold as snow. The river flows down from
the mountain on the side of which is the cave of
Chiron the Centaur. All this I heard in the days
of my youth.”</p>

<p>Over more and more of the sea green of the ring
the red had grown. By this sign we knew that
Zabulun was coming close to us. I spoke to
Eean and I said that we both should make ready
to go to the cave of Chiron the Centaur. Then
when the morning star shone very brightly we
took leave of my father and we went toward where
it shone.</p>

<p>We came to the great waste, and we skirted it
as we had been told. On we went, and we came
to the river, the waters of which were cold as snow.
We turned our faces toward the place from which
the river flowed until we saw a mountain that was
all covered with forest.</p>

<p>Deep and ancient and silent was that upward-growing
forest. So frightened of its silence were
we that we never let go of each other’s hands.
For days we went seeking the cave, and at last
we heard cries&mdash;they might have been from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
birds, they might have been from the winds&mdash;that
said, “Who comes to trouble the rest of
Chiron the ancient Centaur?”</p>

<p>We went toward where the cries came from and
we saw the mouth of the cave. We mounted the
track that led to it, and in fear we went within.</p>

<p>And there was Chiron the ancient Centaur.
His head and his breast, his shoulders and his
arms were a man’s, and his body and his feet and
his tail were a horse’s. His great beard was white,
and his horse’s body was shrunken, but his eyes
were like pools in which there are living fires. The
power of all the kings in the world was in his eyes.</p>

<p>Chiron lay beside a fire in which fragrant woods
burned. He turned his eyes upon it, and we heard
cries as if the winds in the cave made them, “Who
comes to trouble the rest of Chiron the ancient
Centaur?”</p>

<p>I went down on my knees and I prayed him,
“O Chiron, wisest of all who deal in enchantments,”
I said, “there is one named Zabulun, an
evil Enchanter, who pursues us. We have come
to beg you to tell us how we may escape him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not to me should you have come,” the voice
of Chiron boomed out. “What have I to do with
men who are as far from wisdom as Zabulun?
Only one who is like him may strive with him. Go
to another, go to another.”</p>

<p>“To whom shall we go, O Centaur?” I prayed.</p>

<p>“Hermes Trismegistus in Egypt is nearer to
Zabulun than I am. Go to him and he may tell you
how to baffle Zabulun. Tell him that you have
seen the Phœnix in the cave of Chiron the Centaur.”</p>

<p>As he said this there flew into the cave the great
bird that is called the Phœnix. I may not describe
her to you, O King. She flew to the fire
of fragrant-smelling woods and she held herself
above it. She fanned the flame with her wings,
and the fire rose up and caught her breast. Then
the bird sank down on the fire, and we saw her
burn under the eyes of Chiron the Centaur. The
flame died out, and what we saw of the bird that
burned, and the wood that made the fire, was a
heap of ashes.</p>

<p>Then out of that heap of ashes came a bird. It
was smaller than the bird that burned, but more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
radiant. As the bird stayed with the ashes beneath
her feet she grew by some great thing that was
within her, and then she rose over the ashes and
fanned them with her wings. Again I looked upon
the Phœnix.</p>

<p>“Go to Hermes Trismegistus in Egypt, and tell
him that you saw the long-lived Phœnix burn
herself in the cave of Chiron the Centaur, and
come again out of the burning. And when you
tell this to Hermes in Egypt he will tell you what
you may do to make yourself free of Zabulun.”</p>

<p>The Phœnix flew from the cave. Then Chiron
turned his eyes upon us and he spoke to us of the
way we should go to find Hermes Trismegistus
in Egypt. When he had told us all we went backward
out of his cave, and then turned and went
through the depths of the silent forest, taking the
way the Centaur bade us take.</p>

<h3>VIII. <span class="smcap">How Eean and Bird-of-Gold Came to
Hermes Trismegistus in Egypt</span></h3>

<p>We found a ship, and I paid for the voyage out
of the riches I had, and we came to Egypt. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
ring upon my hand showed that we were now far
away from the one who pursued us, from Zabulun
the Enchanter.</p>

<p>But we two lost our way in Egypt, and we wandered
about, reaching nowhere. Then Zabulun
gained upon us again, as the ring showed. We
hid in a village by the river, and we stayed there
until the season when the cranes fly overhead on
their way to Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Then we went from that village, and we came
again upon the way that had been lost. We followed
that way and we came to the great pyramid
in which Hermes Trismegistus had his cell. Down
into the deepest chamber we went, and we came
before Hermes the Egyptian.</p>

<p>He sat before a table that was of diamond and
that had wonderful figures upon it. He was youthful,
and light seemed to come from his forehead.
As wonderful as the eyes of Chiron was the brow
of Hermes Trismegistus.</p>

<p>We knelt at the threshold of his cell, and I said,
“O thrice-great Hermes! We have been in the
cave of Chiron the Centaur, and we have seen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
long-lived Phœnix burn herself to ashes, and come
out of the ashes more radiant than before. Chiron
was kind to us, and he sent us to you, O thrice-great
Hermes. We are pursued by an Enchanter
whose name is Zabulun, and we have come to you
to pray you to tell us how we may make ourselves
free from him.”</p>

<p>Hermes Trismegistus said, “I know of Zabulun,
the wrong-doing Enchanter. But what have I
to do with one who is so removed from wisdom?”</p>

<p>I prayed him again, saying, “Save us from this
wrong-doing Enchanter who would destroy us.
He has come near us often, and he will assuredly
overtake us if you do not give us help, O thrice-great
Hermes.”</p>

<p>Then Hermes said, “Near the Western Island
there dwells an Enchanter whose name is Merlin.
Not one of the great Enchanters is he, nor like to
Chiron or myself, for he chooses to love rather
than to be wise. He is nearer to Zabulun than
we are, but yet he is not a wrong-doing Enchanter.
Go to Merlin and say to him that you have been
within the cell of Hermes Trismegistus, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
you have heard from him the answer to the riddle
that the Sphinx asks, and Merlin will show you
how you both may be saved from Zabulun, the
wrong-doing Enchanter.</p>

<p>“But to come to Merlin’s island, which is west
of the Western Island, you will have first to go
amongst the Atlantes, who live by the Western
Ocean. They eat no living thing and they never
have dreams. When you come to them, seek out
the wisest amongst them, and ask him to tell you
of Merlin, and of how you may come to him.</p>

<p>“To come to the Atlantes you will have to pass
by the Sphinx in the desert. Few ever pass her,
for she has a riddle that she asks of every one.
And the one who cannot answer her riddle is torn
to pieces by the Sphinx. But I shall tell you the
answer to give to the riddle that the Sphinx
asks.”</p>

<p>Then Hermes, thrice-great Hermes, told us the
Sphinx’s riddle and the answer that we should
make to it. He told us the way we should go to
pass by the Sphinx and come to the people that
are called the Atlantes. We left the cell of Hermes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and passed out of the pyramid, and went on our
way.</p>

<p>We came to where the great Sphinx stretches
herself out in the sand, and by the light of a great
moon we saw her lion’s paws and her woman’s
face. We heard the purring sound that comes
through the lips of the Sphinx, and we halted
between her paws.</p>

<p>“What is Man?” said the Sphinx, asking her
riddle.</p>

<p>The paws that stretched alongside of us were
quiet, and the voice of the Sphinx was very quiet.
We saw her face far above us, and it was calm,
though there was much scorn and fierceness in it.</p>

<p>“What is Man?” said the Sphinx.</p>

<p>Then I replied as Hermes Trismegistus had
taught me to reply, “Man is he whose Mother is
the Earth and whose Father is the Stars.”</p>

<p>“Go,” said the Sphinx.</p>

<p>Then we clambered across the great paws of the
Sphinx, and we went on our way. Along the
border of the desert we went, and when the great
moon had changed herself to a little moon that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
was hardly to be seen in the sky we came amongst
the Atlantes, the people who eat no living thing
and who never have dreams.</p>

<p>The ring showed us that Zabulun, the wrong-doing
Enchanter, had not drawn near us for many
days. We were far away from him when we came
amongst the Atlantes. But soon he came near us
again. By that time I had found him who was
wisest amongst this people, and I asked him to
tell me of Merlin, and of how I might come to
him.</p>

<p>“Not often does the island on which Merlin
dwells show itself,” said he who was wisest amongst
the Atlantes. “On the mid day of summer it is
to be seen. Then it draws near to the Western
Island, and if you will cast upon the water nine
cocks’ combs and four peacocks’ feathers, Merlin
will let you come upon his island.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he who was wisest amongst them
gave us the cocks’ combs and four peacocks’
feathers. They reverenced Hermes of Egypt,
the people that are called the Atlantes, and because
we had spoken with Hermes and had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
in his cell, they brought us on board a ship that had
great leathern sails, and in that ship they carried
us to your island, O King.</p>

<h3>IX. <span class="smcap">How Eean and Bird-of-Gold Came to
King Manus’s Stables</span></h3>

<p>We came to your island, O King (said Bird-of-Gold,
continuing her story), but no sooner did
we step from the ship to the landing stones than we
suffered a loss. The ring that was around my
wrist broke and fell into the sea, and thereafter
we had no sign that would show how close Zabulun
was in pursuit of us.</p>

<p>We set off for that part of the land that Merlin’s
island comes near to. One day our way was
through a dark valley and we lay down there to
sleep. I awakened after some hours of slumber,
and I looked toward Eean, and I saw that he was
still sleeping. I left him to his sleep, but when
hours passed I went over to awaken him. But I
could not awaken him from that slumber, do what
I would. For three days and three nights he slept
in that valley while I watched beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he awoke saying, “What day is this,
and how near is Zabulun to us?” I told him that
we were two days from the mid day of summer,
and that we had no sign now to show us how close
the Enchanter might be. We were greatly
troubled, O King, for we knew not how we might
come to Merlin’s island by the mid day of
summer.</p>

<p>It was then that we heard of your horses, King
Manus. We were told of their swiftness, and we
said to each other, “Only by the speed of these
horses can we reach the place that Merlin’s
island comes near, and by Merlin’s aid save
ourselves from the power of Zabulun, the wrong-doing
Enchanter.”</p>

<p>At nightfall we came before your palace and
your stable. Now it was not hard for us to open
the doors of your stable. Your watchers drank
of a drug that I made, O King. Eean brought a
cup to them, and they, thinking the drink had been
sent to them from your supper table, drank it.
At once they fell into a slumber. Then we opened
the four locks of the iron door with the keys that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
were in their belts. Eean went within the stable
while I kept watch at the gate of the orchard.</p>

<p>Alas, Eean was taken before he could mount the
white horse, and before I went to take the bridle
of the red one. I saw him being brought within
the palace, and I saw two new watchers take their
places beside the door.</p>

<p>For a long time I stood in the shadow of the
orchard gate not knowing what to do. Then I
thought that I should still take one of the horses
and go to the place where Merlin might be spoken
to, and so win aid for Eean, my beloved companion.
I made another drug, and I put it into a
drink, and I brought the cup to those who were
at the stable door. These, too, were unsuspecting;
they thought I had brought it from the supper
table, and they drank, and they, too, lost their
senses.</p>

<p>Then I opened the iron door of the stable the
way we had opened it before and I went within.
I saw the red horse in his stall and I put my hand
upon his neck. As I did this the black horse
broke loose, and he plunged at me, and he caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
me by the flesh of the shoulders and he flung me
down. He reared above me, and was about to
bring his hoofs crashing down upon me. Then
indeed I should have been trampled to death
but that you and your men came in, O King.</p>

<p>You came with torches and you drove that
fierce black horse away from my body. Never
was I in such danger of death as I was in then.
I do not think I am now in such danger as when
I lay under the feet of that fierce black horse.
But it is for you to judge, O King.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bird-of-Gold finished her story, and, closing
her eyes, she laid her head upon her hands. All
at that supper table looked toward King Manus.
Eean seemed to hear nothing of her story, for all
the time his eyes were upon the King’s face.</p>

<p>Said King Manus, “She has been in danger as
great as the danger she is in now, for verily, that
black horse of mine is a manslayer. The girl,
too, shall go free.”</p>

<p>Then the King drank another cup of wine and
was silent for a while. Then he said, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
again: “They have fled a great way, these two.
I should not be glad if they lost the match with
this Zabulun. By the open hand of my father,
they may take my two horses, the white one and
the red one, and ride to that part of the Western
Island that Merlin’s island comes near. For
payment to me, let them ask Merlin the Enchanter
what moves I should make in that game of chess
that, for half my lifetime, I have been playing
with King Connal.”</p>

<p>When King Manus said this the last binding
was taken off Eean and off Bird-of-Gold, and they
went to him and they kissed his hands. Eean
promised that they would bring the horses back
to the stable, and he promised, too, that he would
ask Merlin about the moves in the game of chess,
and would bring back the answer to the King.</p>

<p>In the middle of it all, one of the stewards came
to the King, and said there was one in the palace
who knew the youth Eean and who could not be
withheld from coming to him. As they were
speaking about him, he came into the supper room,
an old man, whom they all recognized as the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
who watched before the door of the King’s chamber,
to prevent those who came with requests
that might not be granted being brought before
the King.</p>

<p>He went straight to where Eean stood, and holding
up a torch he looked upon him. He no sooner
looked than he cried out, “It is he&mdash;indeed,
indeed it is he!” And Eean, his hands grasping
the old man, said, “It is Anluan! It is my
father!”</p>

<p>Then it was told to Eean how Anluan had left
the nets of a fisherman after his son had gone with
Zabulun as his apprentice; and it was told, too,
how he had come to the palace, and how he had
been made the officer at the King’s doorway on
account of his extraordinary patience, a patience
that he had learned when he handled the net,
and that wore out the most insistent of those who
came with requests to the King.</p>

<p>There was much rejoicing over the meeting between
Eean and his father Anluan. Then Anluan
turned to her whose hand Eean held, to Bird-of-Gold,
and having wept over her he began to ques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>tion
her about her accomplishments. It was at
this point that the stewards took Anluan away,
for the pair had now to make ready for their ride
to that part of the Western Island that Merlin’s
island came near to on the mid day of summer
which would be the morrow of that very night.
Refreshments were given them at the King’s
table, the newest of meats and the oldest of wines,
and they went out of the hall, and they mounted
the horses that the grooms of King Manus now
brought out for them, Eean taking the white
horse, and Bird-of-Gold the red horse. A bound
and a bound, and the white and the red started
off, spurning the cobblestones of the courtyard,
riding toward their meeting with that Enchanter
who would give them freedom from Zabulun,
Merlin, the Enchanter of the Isle of Britain.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_III" id="PART_III">PART III</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE TWO ENCHANTERS</span></h2>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Merlin and Vivien</span></h3>

<p>A great Enchanter indeed was Merlin. He
served with his enchantments the King of the
Isle of Britain from the time he was a stripling
to the time when he was two score years of age.
Then, when he might have passed from being a
lesser to being a great Enchanter, Merlin vanished
altogether and was seen no more at the court
of the King of the Isle of Britain. All the great
works he had planned were left undone, all the
instruments he had gathered were left unused,
all the books he had brought together were left
unopened, and the King whom he had served so
long was left to whistle for his Enchanter.</p>

<p>If there were one to blame for that it was the
daughter of King Dionas. She was young, but
she was ungentle. What she saw, that she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
have. One day a stranger was passing with her
father, and when he looked on her he said, “A
young hawk she is, a young hawk that has not
yet flown at any prey.” That very day the
daughter of King Dionas walked on the plain that
was at a distance from her father’s castle. The
stranger who had spoken of her to the King was
there, and he looked long upon her.</p>

<p>“Who art thou who lookest on me so?” said
the child.</p>

<p>“Thou art Nimiane, who art also called Vivien,”
said the stranger.</p>

<p>“Yea,” said she, “but who art thou, man?”</p>

<p>“I am called Merlin,” he said, “and I am the
Enchanter to the King of the Isle of Britain.”</p>

<p>“Show me thine enchantments,” said Vivien,
who feared not to speak to any man.</p>

<p>Now Merlin had looked on all the ladies who
were at the court of the King of the Isle of Britain,
and on the maidens who were in far countries and
distant castles, and besides, the ladies of the times
of old had been shown him in his Magic Glass, but
never before had he seen any one who seemed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
lovely to him as this child. She was bright eyed
as a bird. She had a slim body, and pale cheeks,
and quick, quick hands. Her hair was red and
in thick tangles. “Show me thine enchantments,”
she cried to him again.</p>

<p>Merlin bade her come with him and she came.
He brought her to a high place, a place that was
of rock with rocks piled all about it. On the
ground he made magical figures. Then he said
magical words. And all the time Vivien, slim
Vivien with her tangle of red hair, stood upon the
rocks and kept her eyes upon him.</p>

<p>Upon the ground that was all rock Merlin made
a garden with roses blowing and clear waters
flowing, with birds singing amongst the leaves
and fishes swimming in the streams. He made
trees grow, too, with honey-tasting fruits upon
them.</p>

<p>Vivien went through the garden, plucking the
flowers and tasting the fruits that grew there.
She turned to Merlin and looked at him again
with her bright eyes. “Canst thou make a
castle for me?” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Merlin made his magical figures and said
his magical words over again. The stones that
were strewn about everywhere came together and
built themselves up into a castle. When the
castle rose before them Vivien took Merlin by
the hand, and they went through its doorway and
up the stairway and into the castle turret. And
when they looked from the turret Vivien said,
“Would that no one should know of this garden
and this castle but thou and I!”</p>

<p>He told her that the castle and the garden would
be hidden. Then when they were leaving the
garden he put a mist all around, a mist that those
who came that way could not see through and
were made fearful of venturing into.</p>

<p>And so the castle and the garden were all unknown
to men. But Vivien would come, passing
through the mist, and going into the garden and
up into the turret. At first she would not have
Merlin near her. Afterward it came to pass
that she would summon him. A bugle hung in
the turret of the castle, and she would blow upon
it, and he would come and stay by her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>He was two score years of age, and she was
five years less than a score. Nevertheless he
thought it better to watch her dancing with bright
green leaves in her red hair than to know all that
would bring him from being a lesser to being a
great Enchanter. Of the maidens and great
ladies he had seen, some, he told her, were like
light, and some were like flowers, and some were
like a flame of fire. But she, he said, was like the
wind. And he took thought no more for the
King of the Isle of Britain, nor for the great work
he was to do for him, and he spent his days in
watching Vivien, and in listening to Vivien, and
in making magic things for Vivien’s delight.</p>

<p>Her father once took her away from the place
near where the hidden garden and the hidden
castle stood. Vivien was in another country now.
And when she went amongst those who were
strangers to her she found out that nothing
mattered to her except the looks and the words
of Merlin. The castle and the garden&mdash;she did
not think of them, nor of the magic things he
had made for her. Her thoughts were only on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Merlin, who was so wise and who could do such
wonders.</p>

<p>When she came back, and when she met him
in the hidden garden, she caught hold of his hands,
and she would not let go of them. Nor would she
tell Merlin why this change had come over her,
and why she would keep close to him now and not
apart. At last she said to him, “What ladies
and what maidens have you known, O my master
Merlin?”</p>

<p>Then Merlin took his Magic Glass into his hands,
and in it he showed her all the ladies who were
at the court of the King of the Isle of Britain,
and he showed her all the lovely maidens who
lived in far countries and in distant castles whom
he knew. Vivien threw herself on the ground with
her face to the rock after she had looked into the
glass.</p>

<p>Then afterward she watched him in a way
different from the way she had watched him before.
What he said and what he did she remembered
well. Soon she understood his magic figures and
could make them. She came to understand his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
magic words and to be able to repeat them. And
Merlin would say to her, “O my little hawk, fly
at this&mdash;and this&mdash;and this.”</p>

<p>One day as they wandered through a forest
Vivien asked him to tell her the mightiest spell
that he knew. The Enchanter told it to her. She
stood still, with all her quick mind in her face,
while he put aside the tangles of her red hair and
spoke into her ear.</p>

<p>It was a spell that would hold in a place the
one whom it was spoken over. When he had told
her he went at her bidding and seated himself
under a forest tree. Vivien, laughing, made a
magic circle around him and repeated the spell
that he had given her. When she did this the
Enchanter was enchanted. Merlin stayed under
the forest tree, and there he would stay, for he
could not move until the spell that was said over
him was unsaid by Vivien.</p>

<p>And Vivien danced around him, her red hair
shaking, her bright eyes gleaming, her quick hands
waving. She called to him, “Merlin, Merlin Enchanter,
come to me.” But Merlin, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
forest tree, could not move. She ran through
the woods and he could not follow after her. In a
while she came back and stood beside him.</p>

<p>Said Merlin to her, “Why have you worked
this spell upon me, and why have you left me here
so that I cannot move?” She knelt down on
the ground beside where he sat.</p>

<p>“O Merlin,” said she, “I would leave you here
enchanted, for fear you should leave me and go
amongst the maidens and the ladies who are so
lovely.” And when she said that her face was
so hard that he knew she would hold him there.</p>

<p>But Merlin smiled, and he said to her, “I
would stay always where you are, Vivien, blossom
of the furze.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said she, “you would go from me.
Why should you not? You have great works to
do for the King of the land. And when you see
again the ladies and the maidens who are the
loveliest in the world you will not come back again
to Vivien. I shall hate the castle and the garden
that you made for me, and I shall hate every one
who will come near me. I shall hold you, Merlin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
here, even until the wolves come out at night and
devour you and me.”</p>

<p>“I will build a castle for you in an empty
country, and no one shall ever be there but you
and me,” said Merlin.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Vivien, “they will search the world
for you, Merlin, and when they find you, you will
have to go with them.”</p>

<p>Then Merlin, as if it were a magic thing that
would please her, brought out his thought about
the Island of the White Tower. Away beyond the
Western Island, in a sea that is never sailed on,
that island lies. Only on Midsummer Day does
it come near to the Western Island so that men
may see it. There, said Merlin, they might go.
Those who would search for him could never
come to him there. He told her more and more
about the Island of the White Tower, and Vivien
listened in delight to all he told her. And when
he had sworn he would take her to it she unsaid
the spell with which she had bespelled him, and
he rose up from where he had been held, and he
sprang across the magic figure that was drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
upon the ground. And with Vivien Merlin went
through the forest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fishermen who cast their nets by the shores
of the Western Ocean have this story of Merlin
and Vivien. They tell how in a boat of crystal
twelve creatures sailed to the Island of the White
Tower. And two were Merlin and Vivien, and
nine were the nine prime bards of the Isle of
Britain who went with Merlin, and one was the
tame wolf that was Merlin’s servant. They
sailed out upon a Midsummer’s Day, and from
that good day to this no hint or hair of the Enchanter
has been seen by King nor clown in all the
Isle of Britain.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Zabulun the Enchanter</span></h3>

<p>It was Anluan, the father of Eean, Anluan who
had once been a fisherman by the shores of the
Western Ocean, who told this story of the Enchanter
of the Isle of Britain. The fishermen
know the story, and they, more often than any
others, have seen the Island of the White Tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
as it shows itself on the rim of the Western
Ocean.</p>

<p>The story was told after the white horse and
the red horse had clattered across the stones of
the courtyard, bringing Eean and Bird-of-Gold
toward their meeting with Merlin. Candles
thicker than a man’s wrist had been put upon the
supper table; fresh torches had been set in the
sconces along the walls; and logs of resinous wood
had been piled upon the hearth. All this was
done so that the King and his lords might drink
their last cups of wine before they went into the
sleeping chambers.</p>

<p>And now, in the light of shining candles and
blazing torches and mounting hearth fires, the
squires and the servers went amongst the company
filling the wine cups up. Some had already the
wine in their cups, and were waiting for King
Manus to raise his in a health. Then the strangest
of strange things happened. No wind came into
the hall, but suddenly the candles upon the table
and the torches along the walls went out. The
servers went to relight the torches at the hearth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
but the hearth blaze had died down, and all the
logs were black.</p>

<p>And blackness was in the chamber where, a
minute before, candles and torches and hearth
fires were blazing. The King and his lords stood
around the table, while the servers and squires
ran through every chamber of the castle to find a
spark of light.</p>

<p>But not even a spark could they find; not the
light of a rush candle even was to be found in any
hall or chamber in the castle. And on every
stairway the same story was told, how suddenly
light and fire had gone black out.</p>

<p>But now the grooms came in with flints and steel
and tow. Every one tried to strike a spark, but
no spark came for all their striking. And now,
all over the castle, there were outbursts of woe:
the cooks were lamenting that they would have
no fires, and the women were weeping because
lights could not be brought them. It was then
that King Manus bade his lords stand around
laying their hands upon the table.</p>

<p>The next thing was that a figure appeared at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the doorway. All saw it, for there was a line of
faint light around it. It was the figure of a tall
man. “Speak,” said King Manus with his hand
stretched to the figure.</p>

<p>“If you will have me speak,” said the man.</p>

<p>“The lights and the fires have been quenched
in the castle. How has this come to be?”</p>

<p>“It is in the power of an Enchanter of the
second degree to quench light and fire,” said the
man in the darkness. “Further, King Manus:
the fire and light that is extinguished cannot
be brought back until the Enchanter lifts his
ban.”</p>

<p>“Have you come to tell me this?” asked the
King.</p>

<p>“I have come to make a request of you, King
Manus,” said the man in the darkness.</p>

<p>Then Anluan, the father of Eean, he whose
duty it was to let none that might have a request
come face to face with the King, groped around
the room that he might place himself before his
master. But ere he came to where King Manus
stood the man with the line of light around had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
come so close that he and the King looked into
each other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“O King,” said the stranger, “I have answered
what you asked of me. Now I make my request.
It is that the black horse that is in your stable be
given to me.”</p>

<p>There was a stir in the darkened hall, and then
there was an outcry. It was from Anluan, the
father of Eean. “O, King Manus, beware of
the man who knows of the powers of Enchanters.
He may be the one who would ride in chase of
Eean, my son!”</p>

<p>“He has made a request of me,” said King
Manus. “By the open hand of my father, it will
have to be granted him.”</p>

<p>“It is for the one horse that can follow the
others,” Anluan cried.</p>

<p>“I have never refused a request! Alas, alas,
in one night the three horses that were my pride
are taken from me!”</p>

<p>“Strike now, and light candle and torch and
hearth fire,” said the one who had come amongst
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Flint was struck upon steel; sparks came and
made the tow blaze; candle and torch and hearth
fire were lighted again. Then all looked at the
one who had come amongst them.</p>

<p>Tall he was, with a dark and bony face, and eyes
that were like a hawk’s eyes. His dress was a
plain cloak that had a hood that went over his
head. And yet, although he had not the staff
nor the robe of an Enchanter, it did not need
Anluan’s cry to tell the company that here was
the one to whom his son had been apprenticed&mdash;Zabulun
the Enchanter!</p>

<p>“Why do you go in chase of my son?” Anluan
cried.</p>

<p>“Harut and Marut laid hands upon me. Am
I to have no more mastery because of that?”
said Zabulun. “For forty days I was laid in
the cave that is under the sea, and do men think
that all power is gone from me because of that?
I thought all that time that what I worked for
would come to pass, and that the Magic Mirror
of Babylon would be lost in the ruin of the Tower
of Babylon and that destruction would come upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the Babylonians. This would have been if the
boy who was my apprentice had been faithful to
me. But he spoke the words that restored the
mirror to the Kings of Babylon. And I, whose
name, as I thought, would stand forever as one
who had worked a great destruction, am as naught&mdash;my
name is a name to laugh at. And shall
he pass from my mastership, the boy who let
this befall me? Not so; he has still to be my aid.
I have paid you, his father, gold for his seven
years’ service, and his service still belongs to me.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to King Manus, Zabulun said,
“You have granted my request. Command now
that your grooms go to the stable and bring out
the black horse that I am to ride.”</p>

<p>King Manus gave the commands. Then out
of the door of the castle they all went and into the
courtyard. The still light of the dawn, the dawn
of Midsummer’s Day, was coming over the world.
The grooms went to the stable, and in full sight
of all unlocked the great stable door and brought
out the black horse whose swiftness was such
that he could overtake the wind of March that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
was before him, while the wind of March that
was behind could not overtake him. They brought
forth the black horse and they held him while the
dark-faced man put himself astride. Then the
hoofs of the last of the King’s horses struck fire
out of the stones of the courtyard, while a cry
went up from Anluan, the one-time fisherman.</p>

<p>And away went Zabulun the Enchanter, away,
away in pursuit of Eean and Bird-of-Gold, and the
light of the Midsummer Day came into the world.</p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">The Last Flight of Eean and Bird-of-Gold</span></h3>

<p>As the first light of the Midsummer Day came
over the world the two who were fleeing before
him were speaking of Zabulun the Enchanter.
“That we may baffle him,” one said.</p>

<p>“And what if we cannot baffle him this time?”
said the other.</p>

<p>“Then he will take me and make me do terrible
services for him”&mdash;it was Eean who said this&mdash;“and,
worse than all the services he will make
me do, he will separate us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no,” said Bird-of-Gold. “If he takes us
this time, I shall do everything to make myself
useful to the Enchanter. I have thought out
ways in which I can serve him. He will not
separate us and we will be together still.”</p>

<p>“O, Bird-of-Gold,” said Eean, “I am fearful
lest he should slay you for taking the Magic Mirror
off the Tower of Babylon. But I have a sword and
he shall not harm you.”</p>

<p>“I shall escape him,” Bird-of-Gold said, “and as
he followed you and me across the world, so I shall
follow him and you, and we shall never be apart.”</p>

<p>They had learnt in their wanderings all ways of
guiding themselves, and as they galloped on they
were heading for the Western Ocean. Darkness
was around them at first. But the sky was wide
and clear, and Bird-of-Gold, when she raised
her head, could see and name the bright planets.
There was Mars with his red pulse. Bird-of-Gold
likened this planet to the steed that she
bestrode, and as she rode on she sang to herself
the song that the shepherd boys in her own country
used to sing about another star:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">That star, I know, is Betelguise;</div>
<div class="i0">Yet, as I walk the hills by day,</div>
<div class="i0">I hardly know his splendid name&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">That star is far away.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But when at night I travel on,</div>
<div class="i0">Or watch across an empty land,</div>
<div class="i0">Then Betelguise, my star of stars,</div>
<div class="i0">No thing is nearer hand.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Then send a ray that I may own</div>
<div class="i0">The fortune that is mine:</div>
<div class="i0">O Betelguise, my star of stars,</div>
<div class="i0">My forehead’s for your sign!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And after all the countries he had wandered
through, Eean was now back on the ground of
his own country. He heard the cry of the curlews
overhead. He saw the lakes that looked as if
even the birds had forgotten them, so lonely they
were, lonely, but with deep memories. He saw
the cairns of stones above the long dead heroes.
Once he saw a fox upon a cairn, and it seemed to
him that this was the very fox he had chased away
from his mother’s coop the day before the Enchanter
had taken him away from the Western
Island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>With strong hearts King Manus’s horses galloped
on. But the heart of Eean was strained with the
thought of the distance that was still before them.
First, a great mountain that had to be crossed.
Then a wide plain. Then that other mountain from
the top of which one could see the Western Ocean
in the daylight. And Zabulun the Enchanter
might come upon them in the hills or on the plain
and say a word that might stop their horses’ gallop.</p>

<p>But they came to the last mountain top, and
they saw the waters of the Western Ocean with
gleams of gold coming upon them. Adown the
heather-covered hillside their horses hurried. And
as the broad sun rose over the broad ocean the
feet of the white and the red horse were scattering
the foam along the shore.</p>

<p>And as they watched they saw Merlin’s island
grow out of the dimness of the sea. Then the
sun became fuller and it lighted up the White
Tower, and Eean and Bird-of-Gold knew they had
come to their journey’s end indeed. They sprang
off their horses, and they dipped their hands in
the sea, and they kissed each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now we must cast over on the island the tokens
that the Atlantes gave us,” Eean said, “the
cocks’ combs and the peacocks’ feathers. If they
come to Merlin, he will let us cross to his island,
and we can swim our horses over. But how shall
we know if the tokens come to him?”</p>

<p>He raised the bag in which were the cocks’ combs
and the four peacocks’ feathers. He cast the bag
toward the island. Through the air it went like
a flying bird.</p>

<p>They mounted their horses again, ready to
swim them across when they got some signal
from the island. And the signal came. It was
the howl of the wolf that was Merlin’s servant.</p>

<p>Now they were to swim their horses across. As
they went into the water, Bird-of-Gold looked
back. Down through the heather of the hillside
a rider was coming. He was on a black horse.
They knew him for Zabulun, the Enchanter from
whom they were fleeing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">How Eean Won His Release from
Zabulun the Enchanter</span></h3>

<p>Merlin, with the tame wolf that was his servant
beside him, was standing by the White Tower on
the morning of that Midsummer Day. And
Vivien was upon the tower, singing to her colored
birds and looking out over the sea.</p>

<p>Vivien, who played with her colored birds, had
still the look of a child in her face. Her hair was
no longer in tangles; it was softer than it was
once, and it fell softly over her shoulders. Her
eyes, for all the child’s look that was in her face,
were as if they had seen many things come and
change and pass.</p>

<p>Like a King, or like one who had been always near
a King, was Merlin the Enchanter. He smiled,
and his smile was calm and royal. But one might
have said that his eyes were strangely close to
each other and that his lips were strangely red.</p>

<p>His beard was long and gray. He wore a white
robe with a belt of green leaves around it, and a
chaplet of oak leaves was on his head. Vivien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
was dressed in green, with a golden belt clasped
around her, and with green leaves in her soft hair.</p>

<p>So they were standing by and on the tower,
Merlin, Vivien, and Merlin’s tame wolf, when
the tokens that were from the Atlantes came.
Merlin laid his hand upon the wolf, and the wolf
gave the howl that was the signal for Eean and
Bird-of-Gold to come on the Island of the White
Tower. The Enchanter saw them ride their
horses into the water. And then another token
came to him&mdash;the token that one magician sends
to another, a Bird of Foam it was, and Zabulun
sent it.</p>

<p>Deep were the waters, but great-hearted were
the horses of King Manus, the white horse and
the red horse, and with Eean and Bird-of-Gold
astride of them they swam to the Island of the
White Tower. They came to the sloping shore,
and the riders helped the horses up to the hard
ground. The white and the red horse stood
shivering from their plunge into the ocean.
Afterward they threw themselves on the grass
and lay as still as if they were dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Not to the horses, but out to the sea did Eean
and Bird-of-Gold look. The black horse with
Zabulun astride him was swimming now. Swiftly
to the White Tower where they saw Merlin stand
they went.</p>

<p>“O, Merlin,” Eean cried, “to you we have
come to save us from the Enchanter who has
pursued us from one end of the world to the other.”</p>

<p>“From whom have you come, you who have
sent such tokens?” said Merlin.</p>

<p>“From Hermes Trismegistus in his secret cell.
And Hermes bade us say to you that we have
heard from him the answer to the riddle that the
Sphinx asks, and that we crossed the desert to
come to you, answering the Sphinx.”</p>

<p>“Who is the Magician who pursues you?”</p>

<p>“Zabulun, once a Prince in Babylon, O Merlin.”</p>

<p>“Is it he who pursues you?&mdash;Zabulun! I
shall have a welcome for Zabulun.”</p>

<p>“Save us, O Merlin, from Zabulun,” Bird-of-Gold
cried.</p>

<p>Vivien came down from the tower. “It is
Zabulun who comes to our island in chase of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
two, my Vivien,” Merlin said. “Now you shall
see me match my power with Zabulun’s.”</p>

<p>“A match between magicians, how entertaining
it will be!” cried Vivien, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>“O lady, if Zabulun is not baffled it will be
death or separation for us,” said Bird-of-Gold to
her.</p>

<p>“Merlin will baffle him&mdash;you will find that
Merlin will baffle him,” said Vivien. “You see,
he has done nothing to impress me for an age.”</p>

<p>Now Merlin had sent the tame wolf that was
his servant upon an errand, and the wolf at this
moment returned leading nine men who wore
white robes and who had chaplets of oak leaves
upon their brows. These were the nine prime
bards of the Isle of Britain who had come to the
Island of the White Tower with Merlin, their chief.</p>

<p>They stood as he bade them, four on one side
and five on the other, with the Enchanter of the
Isle of Britain between them. Merlin bade Eean
stand with the four bards. He touched them
with his staff, and the row of bards and Eean with
them became all as alike as ten peas in a pea pod.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
And Merlin went to Bird-of-Gold and touched her
also, and she became like the lady Vivien exactly.</p>

<p>Now the black horse that bore Zabulun came
to the sloping bank of the Island of the White
Tower, and Zabulun sprang off his back and drew
the black horse up on the bank. The horse
breathed mightily, and then like the others lay
down on the grass.</p>

<p>With great and sure strides Zabulun came to
the White Tower where Merlin stood. “Hail,
Merlin,” he cried in a loud voice.</p>

<p>“Hail, Zabulun.”</p>

<p>“You know of an apprentice of mine who has
come to your island.”</p>

<p>“Find him, O mighty magician.”</p>

<p>Zabulun looked and saw the ten men who
looked exactly alike, and the two women whom one
could not tell one from the other. He turned to
Merlin then and he said, “What a simple trick
you would play upon me! Nine bards you have,
and there are ten before us. One of them is Eean,
the boy apprenticed to me.”</p>

<p>“Then you will take him, Zabulun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>It is certain that Merlin did not think that
Zabulun would do what he did now. He changed
himself into a hound. Running amongst the ten
that were there he snuffed at them. By the smell
of the horse he had ridden he would find Eean.</p>

<p>But as he ran amongst them Merlin touched
each of the ten bards and Eean with them with
his staff. They all became pigeons and flew up
into the air. One had a feather awry. This was
Eean on whom Zabulun had laid a paw just as he
was being transformed.</p>

<p>Instantly Zabulun changed himself into a hawk
and strove to rise above the flock of pigeons. As
he did he saw the one that had a feather awry.
Over him he came.</p>

<p>Then Eean, seeing the hawk above him, dropped
instantly to the earth. The others flew down with
him, crowding around to hide the ruffled feather.
They came before the door of Merlin’s house.
They flew in and lighted down on the floor while
the hawk came sweeping up to the doorway.</p>

<p>Merlin touched the pigeons with his staff and
again transformed them. They became ten rings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of gold that lay upon the floor. As the hawk
flew in and perched on a chair to fix his eyes upon
them, the rings of gold rolled into the fire.</p>

<p>Then Zabulun transformed himself into a tongs,
and went hunting through the fire for the rings.
He picked up one ring and flung it out on the
floor, he picked up another ring and flung it out
on the floor, and so on, until the ten rings were
out of the fire. Merlin touched the rings with his
staff, and they were transformed into ten grains of
corn. Upon these ten grains Vivien and Bird-of-Gold
threw handful after handful of grains of corn.</p>

<p>But now Zabulun changed himself into a cock
with strong legs and wide claws and a hungry beak.
With his claws he scratched through the heap of
grain. With his beak he picked the grains up.
Vivien and Bird-of-Gold kept throwing on the floor
handful after handful of corn to cover the ten grains.</p>

<p>But the beak of the cock went so fiercely and
so hungrily amongst them that only a few grains
more than the ten were left upon the floor when
Vivien and Bird-of-Gold found out they had no
more handfuls to fling. Then it seemed as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the cock with his sharp eye would soon pick out
the grain that was Eean.</p>

<p>Then with his staff Merlin touched nine of the
grains, leaving one untouched. The one he left
untouched was Eean. The nine were changed into
weasels, and they faced the cock fiercely. Then
was Zabulun startled. Instead of picking at the
grain that was Eean he fluttered up from the
ground, and went out of the door of the house.</p>

<p>Merlin touched the grain that was left and
Eean stood up. Bird-of-Gold clapped her hands
for joy on seeing him again. But Eean ran out of
the door of the house after the cock that was
Zabulun the Enchanter. He snatched up a strong
staff as he ran.</p>

<p>Zabulun had changed back into his own form.
But now Eean had no fear of him. He ran
toward him. And Zabulun took up a staff that
was lying there and made to defend himself.</p>

<p>Then began the battle between Eean and
Zabulun. Eean struck at Zabulun, and Zabulun
struck at Eean, and each defended himself with
the staff that he had. They fought their way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
across the island, from one side to the other.
They fought until their staves were broken and
until they were covered with bruises. Then they
threw away their staves and gripped one another.
All around the island they wrestled. Strong were
the hands of Zabulun upon Eean, and yet Eean
was not thrown by Zabulun. Eean felt his own
hands were strong upon Zabulun, and yet he could
not throw him. Soon Eean lost sense of everything
except two gripping and rocking figures.</p>

<p>They wrestled their way across the island,
down to the shore where they had landed and
where the three horses of King Manus were lying.
They wrestled until the sea water came over their
feet. Again things became clear to Eean. He
knew that if he could overthrow the Enchanter he
would win his freedom from him.</p>

<p>He fastened upon Zabulun a grip that seemed
to be stronger than his own life. He heaved with
a power that seemed to bring up his last breath.
He bent Zabulun over. He brought him down,
his head in the water. He flung himself upon the
prone Enchanter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>“What would you have of me?” Zabulun said
at last.</p>

<p>“Release. Say you have no more mastership
in me.”</p>

<p>“I say it. I have no more mastership in you.
You have release from me.”</p>

<p>“I let you rise.”</p>

<p>Then Eean took his grip off Zabulun. The Enchanter
rose up and took himself out of the water.</p>

<p>So Zabulun was defeated, and so release was
given to Eean, The Boy Apprenticed to the Enchanter.
Zabulun mounted the black horse that
was King Manus’s and had him swim the water.
He rode across the plain and over one mountain
and another mountain until he came to the castle
of King Manus. There he left the horse to neigh
for his grooms.</p>

<p>What became of Zabulun afterward is not
written in the book that is the History of the
Enchanters. Some say that from that Midsummer’s
Day he ceased to be named with the
great Enchanters. The powers he had gained,
they say, shrank from him. Afterward a famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
juggler appeared in the world. He used to go
into the halls of Kings on festival nights and do
marvelous feats with balls and rings and knives,
and play music on all manner of instruments,
going from King’s castle to King’s castle. That
juggler, they say&mdash;but they may be mistaken&mdash;was
Zabulun, once Prince of Babylon, and once
master of the Inaccessible Island.</p>

<p>Eean and Bird-of-Gold went within the White
Tower, and conversed from noon to dusk with
Merlin and the lady Vivien. Before that Midsummer’s
Day had passed into darkness, they
mounted the white steed and the red steed and
had them swim across the waters. When they
came to the farther shore they let the horses stand
for a while. Then mounting them again they
rode over the mountains and across the plains
and came again to the castle of King Manus.</p>

<h3>V. <span class="smcap">The Return of King Manus’s Horses</span></h3>

<p>Again Manus, King of the Western Island, sat
in his supper hall. The torches were in their
sconces, the candles were lighted on the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the hearth fire was blazing on the hearth, and his
lords once again sat to the right and the left of
him. But this time they sat without laughter
and without high words.</p>

<p>The harper and the story-teller were at the table
too, but they neither made music nor told stories.
They had tried, both, that evening, but no one
had listened to them. Outside, the iron door of
the stable gaped wide, and the grooms and horse
boys and watchers stood idly around or went
quarreling amongst themselves. It was very
difficult, as you may imagine, for the harper to
play upon his harp when he would hear the King
say into his wine cup, “O, Raven, my black
horse, where art thou now?” And it was equally
difficult for the story-teller to get on with his tale
when he would see the King looking at him with
unseeing eyes and hear him say, “O, my white
and my red horses, what would I not give if I
saw you back in my courtyard again?”</p>

<p>So you can imagine the silence that was upon
the supper board that was wont to resound with
conversation and story-telling, with music and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
pledges of the wine cup. “O, Raven, my black
horse, where art thou now?” said the King once
again; and then, “What would I not give to have
my white and my red horse in the courtyard
again?” And these were all the words that King
Manus could be got to say.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, a loud neigh was heard
outside. Straightway King Manus ran out of
the supper hall. The lords, the minstrel, and the
story-teller, the stewards, servers, and attendants,
ran with him. And when they came as far as
the wide door of the castle they ran into the grooms
and the horse boys who were running from the
stable. All ran together. And there, in the
middle of the courtyard, without a rider upon his
back, was Raven, the King’s black horse.</p>

<p>They brought him into his stall in the stable,
and they combed him and they groomed him;
they gave him the red wheat and the white barley
to eat and the clear spring water to drink. King
Manus could hardly be prevailed upon to leave
Raven’s stall and come back into the supper
hall. But at length they got him back into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
seat, and then the supper board resounded with
pledges of the wine cup as the King and his lords
drank to each other merrily.</p>

<p>Again there was neighing in the courtyard,
this time a double neighing. Straightway the
King ran out and all who were near ran with him.
They ran into the grooms and the horse boys who
were running from the stable. There in the
courtyard were the white horse and the red horse.
They were not unmounted, however, for Eean
and Bird-of-Gold were upon them.</p>

<p>This time King Manus grew into such glee that
he swore by the open hand of his father that he
would make a duke of every lord who was with
him that night. There were great rejoicings.
Some tossed their torches so high that they
frightened the owls out of the cornices on the
castle. The grooms brought the white horse and
the red horse into their stalls in the stable, and
they fed them with red wheat and white barley,
and gave them the clear spring water to drink.</p>

<p>Then they went to carry Eean and Bird-of-Gold
into the supper hall. They were not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
found for a while, for Anluan, Eean’s father, had
led them away. He was seen to weep over Eean,
and to take the hands of Bird-of-Gold and kiss
her while he called her daughter. And to Anluan
King Manus gave the privilege of bringing them
to the supper board.</p>

<p>The King put Eean into the story-teller’s seat,
but he had Bird-of-Gold sit beside him on his left
hand. The feast began all over again, and went
on from egg to apple. And when wine had been
drunk King Manus called upon Eean to tell the
story of his journey to Merlin’s Island and the
full tale of how he had defeated Zabulun the
Enchanter.</p>

<p>When all was told the King gave presents to
Eean and Bird-of-Gold and he swore that for a
year and a day he would have them live with him
in his castle. “And,” said he, “this girl, Bird-of-Gold,
has been very loving and faithful to you as
you have been to her, and for a further benefit
to you I shall have the old blind sage come down
from his attic in the castle and marry you here
and now.” Eean and Bird-of-Gold took each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
other’s hands as he said this, and the old blind
sage was brought down from his attic chamber,
and he married Bird-of-Gold and Eean by the
rays of the rising sun.</p>

<p>For a year and a day they lived in King Manus’s
royal castle. Now Eean had learnt so much of
the arts and crafts and mysteries that belong to
an Enchanter that he was able to do great works
for the King. Castles he built that gave security,
and bridges that brought people together, and
mills that ground for the people abundance of
corn. He had become so strong and so sure
of himself since his encounter with Zabulun that
all he set out to perform he did well. And his
wife, Bird-of-Gold, loved him so much that her
thought never went back to the country she had
come from. Always, they say, she kept a flock
of white ducks; perhaps they reminded her of the
thousand ducks that was the fortune she brought
into Babylon.</p>

<p>But the story-teller must not forget to tell you
about the question that Eean asked Merlin the
Enchanter on King Manus’s behalf. It was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a game of chess that King Manus had been playing
with his brother-in-law, King Connal, for half
their lifetimes without either having victory in
sight. Moreover, they had inherited the game
from their fathers, and it was now being played
for fifty years. Merlin told Eean what the moves
should be, and the day after he came to the castle,
Eean took the chess board and showed them to
the King. With that instruction he played. The
game of chess was finished three days afterwards,
and great fame and honor came to King Manus.</p>

away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
